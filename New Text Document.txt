Overall Goal: Build a model to predict customer churn for Religare, a broking firm.
Guiding Framework (from initial case study):
Phase 1: Data Preprocessing (Feature Engineering, Imbalance Treatment - Oversampling & Undersampling)
Phase 2: Model Training & Testing (Hyperparameter Optimization, Training, Performance Assessment)
Key Data Sources & Definitions:
Sources:
biuser.tblclientdetail: Client master (Activation Date, Last Ledger, Last Trade).
biuser.tblfactbrokcube: Daily aggregated brokerage (Client, Trade Date, Gross Brokerage).
biuser.VWCASHMARGINCOLLECTED: Deposits (Client, Deposit Date, Realized Amount).
BIUSER.LD_VWACCOUNTADDRESSDETAI: Official Dormancy (Client, Parsed Dormancy Date) - Decision: Excluded from predictive model but used for initial analysis.
BIUSER.LD_VWPAYOUTREQUEST: Payouts (Client, Payout Date, Approved Amount).
NEW: Login Data (Files: LOGIN_YYYY-MM.txt, Format: ClientCode,DD/MM/YYYY, No Header, Location: /content/drive/MyDrive/LOG_NEW/).
Primary Key: CLIENTCODE.
Initial Target Modeling Period: Snapshots from 2021-01-01 to 2023-12-31.
Prediction Windows for Churn: 90, 180, 270, and 365 days.
Churn Definition (Current for Predictive Model):
A client snapshot is Churned (Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays = 1) if BOTH are true:
Recently Active (Condition A): Client had (Trade_Days_Count_XXXD > 0 OR Login_Days_Count_XXXD > 0) in the XXX days before the snapshot.
Became Inactive (Condition B): Client had (Trade_Days_In_Churn_Window_XXX <= 0 AND Login_Days_In_Churn_Window_XXX <= 0) in the XXX days after the snapshot.
Otherwise, Not Churned = 0.
(XXX represents 90, 180, 270, 365)
Summary of Progress & Key Decisions:
Initial SQL ABT Generation Attempt: Explored creating a single complex SQL query. Decided against it due to complexity and performance concerns.
Switched to PySpark with CSV Intermediates:
Defined 5 SQL queries to extract raw data from Oracle sources into separate .txt (delimited text) files.
Developed a PySpark script (generate_predictive_abt.ipynb in Colab) to read these CSV/TXT files and perform feature engineering.
Data Loading Issues & Fixes (PySpark):
Addressed Windows winutils.exe issues initially by suggesting setup, then shifted to Colab.
Resolved various NameError exceptions in Colab by ensuring correct import order and variable definition scope.
Corrected CSV/TXT read options (delimiter, date format, header presence) for each input file, especially for login data (no header, wildcard path) and initial dormancy data issues.
Step 1 (Revised Plan) - Analyze Past Activity:
Goal: Understand behavior of clients who became inactive vs. remained active.
Initial Cohort Definition (using Dormancy): Compared clients officially dormant in FY23-24 with active clients.
Key EDA Finding: Days_Since_Last_Trade and recent activity levels (e.g., Trade_Days_FY2223) were strong differentiators. Yearly deltas were less significant for this specific cohort comparison. Payout data initially showed 0 count for the analysis cohort, which was fixed by trim() on CLIENTCODE joins.
Strategic Shift - Excluding Official Dormancy Data:
Decision: Based on concerns about data quality/policy changes for official Dormancy_Date and the goal of predicting before official dormancy, we decided to exclude the dormancy data from the predictive model's target definition and features.
Revised Churn Definition: Focused purely on trading inactivity initially, then refined to include login inactivity.
Strategic Shift - Refining Churn Definition & Prediction Windows:
Initial ABT Issue: The first ABT with just trading inactivity resulted in ~93% \"churned\" instances, indicating the definition was too broad or the labels were inverted.
Decision: Refined churn to require recent activity (trade OR login) before the snapshot, followed by complete inactivity (NO trade AND NO login) after the snapshot.
Decision: Implemented churn labels for 90, 180, 270, and 365-day prediction windows.
ABT Generation (Current Stage - generate_predictive_abt.ipynb):
The script loads data from the 5 TXT files (client, trade, payout, deposit, login).
Calculates numerous features: tenure, recency (trade, funding, login), frequency (trade, login for 30/90/180/270/365 day lookbacks), monetary (brokerage), funding flows, ratios, and deltas (for 90-day trade, funding, login frequency).
Calculates the 4 refined churn labels (Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays).
Applies a final filter to snapshots based on latest_transaction_data_available and max_prediction_window.
Current Status: Script execution reached Cell 12 (fillna) but failed on Gross_Brokerage_Sum_30D not being calculated in Cell 10.
Important Data/Outputs/References Generated (Conceptually):
Filtered SQL Extraction Queries: (Provided earlier, used to create the source TXT files).
PySpark Script for ABT Generation: The Colab notebook generate_predictive_abt.ipynb containing Cells 1-17 (current version needs the fix for Gross_Brokerage_Sum_30D in Cell 12's fillna).
EDA Insights from Step 1 Analysis Notebook: Identified recency and recent activity levels as key differentiators. Highlighted that yearly deltas weren't strong for that specific past dormancy analysis.
Sample Data Formats (from TXT files): Used to debug and correct PySpark read options.

Previous ABT Parquet File:
What: We successfully generated an initial Analytical Base Table (ABT) and saved it as a Parquet directory.
Location on Google Drive (as last defined): /content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_full/abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet
Key Characteristic: This ABT was generated before we decided to:
Exclude official dormancy data from the churn definition and features.
Refine the churn definition to be based on both trading AND login inactivity (requiring prior engagement).
Explicitly calculate and include login-based features.
Focus on 90, 180, 270, and 365-day refined churn prediction windows.
Action for the New ABT Generation:
Overwrite or New Location: When we run the revised generate_predictive_abt.ipynb script (the one with all the latest changes for login features and the refined churn definition), the final_abt_df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(output_path_parquet) command will handle this.
The output_path_parquet variable in the current version of that script is:
output_abt_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred' # New output dir
output_file_name_base = \"predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023\"
output_path_parquet = os.path.join(output_abt_dir, f\"{output_file_name_base}.parquet\") 

This points to: /content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet
Since we defined a new output directory (output_abt_final_pred), the new ABT will be saved in a different location, and the old one in /content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_full/ will remain untouched unless you explicitly delete it.
If you had pointed output_abt_dir to the same location as the old ABT, then mode(\"overwrite\") would indeed overwrite the previous Parquet files.
To include in your summary for the new chat:
\"We previously generated an ABT Parquet file located at /content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_full/abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet. However, due to significant strategic changes in feature inclusion (adding login data) and churn definition (focusing on combined trading/login inactivity and removing official dormancy data), the current generate_predictive_abt.ipynb script is designed to create a new, distinct ABT. This new ABT will be saved to a different location (/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet) and will be the basis for all subsequent modeling work.\"

Proceed to Modeling Notebook (Churn_Modeling.ipynb):
Load the NEW ABT.
Select Target: Start with target_col_name = 'Is_Churned_Engage_270Days'.
Train/Test Split: Perform time-based split.
Imbalance Handling: Use class weighting (weightCol) with Spark ML.
Feature Scaling: Use Spark ML StandardScaler.
Model Training: Start with LogisticRegression from pyspark.ml.classification. Then try RandomForestClassifier and GBTClassifier.
Evaluation: Use Spark ML evaluators for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, Precision, Recall, F1. Attempt robust Confusion Matrix component calculation.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Plan for using CrossValidator and ParamGridBuilder after initial model runs.
Feature Importance: Analyze for the best performing model.
Iterate: Repeat modeling for Is_Churned_Engage_90Days and Is_Churned_Engage_180Days (and maybe 365) to compare.
(Future) Refine Features: Based on model performance and feature importance, consider adding:
The \"Large/First Significant Payout Flag\".
Client value segmentation (Brokerage_Category).

*   Make sure to highlight the *actionable immediate next step* for ABT generation (the `Gross_Brokerage_Sum_30D` fix).
*   Double-check all file paths and variable names mentioned.
*   Confirm I've acknowledged the future \"new approach\" and the expert role.

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, I've processed all the information. Here's my understanding of the Religare Customer Churn Prediction project:

**Overall Project Goal:**
To build a robust machine learning model that can predict customer churn for Religare, a broking firm. This involves identifying clients who are likely to become inactive after a period of engagement.

**Current Project Phase & Status:**
We are at the cusp of completing Phase 1 (Data Preprocessing) and moving into Phase 2 (Model Training & Testing).
*   **Analytical Base Table (ABT) Generation:** The primary focus has been on creating a comprehensive ABT using PySpark (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`).
    *   **Data Sources:**
        *   `client_details.txt` (from `biuser.tblclientdetail`) - Path: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/client_details.txt`
        *   `trade_data.txt` (from `biuser.tblfactbrokcube`) - Path: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/trade_data.txt`
        *   `payout_data.txt` (from `BIUSER.LD_VWPAYOUTREQUEST`) - Path: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/payout_data.txt`
        *   `deposit_data.txt` (from `biuser.VWCASHMARGINCOLLECTED`) - Path: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/deposit_data.txt`
        *   Login data (`LOGIN_*.txt` files) - Path: `/content/drive/MyDrive/LOG_NEW/LOGIN_*.txt`
    *   **Key Strategic Decisions & Evolution:**
        1.  **Shift from SQL to PySpark:** Initial complex SQL ABT generation was abandoned for a more manageable PySpark approach using intermediate TXT/CSV files.
        2.  **Exclusion of Official Dormancy Data:** `BIUSER.LD_VWACCOUNTADDRESSDETAI` was initially used for EDA but excluded from the predictive model's features and target definition due to concerns about data quality, policy changes, and the desire to predict churn *before* official dormancy.
        3.  **Refined Churn Definition:** This is a critical change. The current definition is:
            *   A client is \"Churned\" for a snapshot if they were **Recently Active** (traded OR logged in) in the XXX days *before* the snapshot, AND then became **Completely Inactive** (NO trades AND NO logins) in the XXX days *after* the snapshot.
            *   Prediction windows (XXX) are 90, 180, 270, and 365 days.
            *   This refinement was necessary after an earlier definition (based only on trading inactivity) led to an imbalanced ~93% churn rate.
        4.  **Inclusion of Login Data:** Login activity is now a core component of both feature engineering and the churn definition.
    *   **Feature Engineering:** The PySpark script calculates a rich set of features, including:
        *   Tenure.
        *   Recency (last trade, last funding, last login).
        *   Frequency (trade days, login days over 30, 90, 180, 270, 365-day lookbacks).
        *   Monetary (brokerage sums).
        *   Funding flows (deposits, payouts, net flow).
        *   Ratios and Deltas (e.g., 90-day changes in trade/funding/login frequency).
    *   **Current ABT Script Status:** The `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` script is almost complete. The last known issue was a `NameError` in Cell 12 related to `Gross_Brokerage_Sum_30D` not being found during `fillna`, indicating it might not have been correctly calculated or named in Cell 10. This needs to be fixed to successfully generate the final ABT.
    *   **New ABT Output:** The refined ABT will be saved to a **new location**: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet`. This is distinct from a previous, outdated ABT (`/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_full/abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet`) which did not include login data or the refined churn definition.

**Next Steps (Phase 2 - Modeling in `Churn_Modeling.ipynb`):**
Once the new ABT is generated and validated:
1.  **Load the New ABT:** From the `output_abt_final_pred` directory.
2.  **Target Selection:** Begin with `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`.
3.  **Train/Test Split:** Implement a time-based split to reflect real-world prediction scenarios.
4.  **Imbalance Handling:** Use class weighting (via `weightCol` in Spark ML). Oversampling/undersampling were considered in the guiding framework, but class weighting is the immediate plan.
5.  **Feature Scaling:** Apply `StandardScaler`.
6.  **Model Training:**
    *   Start with `LogisticRegression`.
    *   Progress to `RandomForestClassifier` and `GBTClassifier`.
7.  **Evaluation:**
    *   Metrics: AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
    *   Calculate and analyze the Confusion Matrix.
8.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use `CrossValidator` and `ParamGridBuilder`.
9.  **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identify key drivers of churn.
10. **Iteration:** Repeat the modeling process for other churn windows (`Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`, `Is_Churned_Engage_180Days`, possibly `365Days`).
11. **Future Feature Refinements (Post-Initial Models):**
    *   \"Large/First Significant Payout Flag.\"
    *   \"Brokerage_Category\" (client value segmentation).
    *   Interaction features.

Subject: Incorporating Existing Client Classification Logic into Churn Project

Hi Team,

Further to our discussion on the churn prediction project, I have details on an existing Excel-based client classification system we can leverage.

Summary of the System:

The system assigns clients a Total Score based on calculated scores for Trading Days, AUM, Brokerage, and Recency.

These scores use specific inputs (e.g., Last 36 M DAYS TRADED, AUM_AH_CUT, Max 6/36 M Brok, various last activity dates) and compare them against calculated benchmarks/targets, applying weights from a configuration ('Algo') sheet.

The Total Score maps to defined Slabs/Tags (e.g., \"New,\" \"Classic,\" \"Silver,\" \"Gold,\" \"Platinum\").

The specific file reflects classifications as of a fixed date (e.g., 31-Jan-2025).

Integration Plan for Historical Analysis (2021-23 Data):

To avoid lookahead bias, we won't use the static file's classifications directly on past data. Instead:

Replicate Logic Historically: We will recreate the Excel scoring and classification logic within our ABT generation process.

Calculate Historical Scores/Slabs: For each client and each SnapshotDate in our 2021-23 ABT, we will:

Gather the necessary underlying data points (trade days, AUM, brokerage, dates) as they were at that specific SnapshotDate.

Recalculate the score components, total score, and the resulting Slab/Tag using the Excel logic, referenced against that SnapshotDate.

Add as Features: These Historical_Total_Score and Historical_Slab values will be added as new features to our ABT.

Enhanced Analysis: This allows us to:

Train the model using features that reflect established business logic.

Analyze model performance and churn drivers specifically within these historical business segments (e.g., comparing churn patterns for historical \"Gold\" vs. \"Classic\" clients).

Requirement: This requires access to the necessary historical underlying data points (AUM, trade counts, brokerage, activity dates) for each client over the 2021-23 period.

This approach integrates valuable business context directly into our model development and analysis.

This message clearly states:

What the classification system is.

The plan to replicate it historically (avoiding bias).

How it enhances the ABT and analysis.

1.  **Understand the Core Request:** The user wants to incorporate an existing client classification system (currently Excel-based) into the Religare churn prediction project. The goal is to use this classification logic to enhance the model and analysis.

2.  **Identify Key Information about the Classification System:**
    *   **Inputs:** Trade Days (36M), AUM, Brokerage (Max 6/36M), Recency (various last activity dates).
    *   **Process:** Calculates scores for each input against benchmarks/targets, applies weights (from 'Algo' sheet), sums to a Total Score.
    *   **Output:** Maps Total Score to Slabs/Tags (New, Classic, Silver, Gold, Platinum).
    *   **Current Implementation:** Excel file, static snapshot (e.g., as of 31-Jan-2025).

3.  **Recognize the Central Challenge:** Using a static, future classification (Jan 2025) directly on historical data (2021-23) would introduce **lookahead bias**. A client classified as \"Platinum\" in 2025 might have been \"Classic\" in 2022. Applying the 2025 label to 2022 data would give the model information it wouldn't have had at that time, leading to overly optimistic performance and poor real-world generalization.

4.  **Formulate the Solution:** The only valid way to use this logic is to **replicate it historically**.
    *   **Concept:** For *each* snapshot date in the ABT (e.g., 2021-01-31, 2021-02-28, ..., 2023-12-31), calculate what the client's classification *would have been* based on their activity and metrics *up to that specific snapshot date*.
    *   **Implementation:** This means integrating the scoring and mapping logic into the PySpark ABT generation script (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`).

5.  **Detail the Implementation Steps within the ABT Generation:**
    *   **Gather Inputs:** Ensure the ABT script already calculates or has access to the necessary historical inputs for *each* snapshot date:
        *   Trade days (need 36-month lookback relative to the snapshot date).
        *   AUM (Asset Under Management) - *Crucial: Is historical AUM data available? This is a potential new data requirement.*
        *   Brokerage (need 6-month and 36-month max/sum relative to the snapshot date).
        *   Recency dates (last trade, last login, last funding, etc. - already calculated).
    *   **Replicate Logic:** Translate the Excel formulas (benchmarks, weights, score calculations, slab mapping) into PySpark code (using `when`, `col`, arithmetic operations). The 'Algo' sheet parameters will need to be coded as constants or loaded from a separate configuration if they change over time (though assuming they are static for now is a reasonable starting point).
    *   **Calculate Scores/Slabs:** For each row (Client + SnapshotDate) in the ABT DataFrame, apply the replicated logic to compute:
        *   `Historical_Trading_Score`
        *   `Historical_AUM_Score`
        *   `Historical_Brokerage_Score`
        *   `Historical_Recency_Score`
        *   `Historical_Total_Score`
        *   `Historical_Slab` (or `Historical_Tag`)
    *   **Add as Features:** Append these newly calculated columns to the ABT DataFrame.

6.  **Identify Benefits:** How does this help?
    *   **Richer Features:** Adds business-relevant context as features for the ML model. The model can learn if historical classification is predictive of future churn.
    *   **Segmented Analysis:** Allows analysis of churn patterns *within* different historical segments (e.g., Do clients who were historically \"Gold\" churn differently than those who were \"Classic\"?). This provides deeper business insights.

7.  **State the Requirements/Dependencies:**
    *   **Logic Details:** Need the exact Excel formulas, benchmark values, weights, and slab mapping rules.
    *   **Historical Data:** Critically, need access to *historical* AUM data corresponding to the snapshot dates. The other inputs (trade days, brokerage, recency) are likely already derivable from the existing data sources (`tblfactbrokcube`, `tblclientdetail`, login logs, etc.). If historical AUM isn't available, this plan needs modification or cannot be fully implemented.

8.  **Structure the Summary Message:** Organize the points logically for clarity.
    *   Start with the subject/context.
    *   Summarize the existing system.
    *   Highlight the lookahead bias problem.
    *   Present the solution (historical replication).
    *   Detail the implementation steps (gather inputs, replicate logic, calculate, add features).
    *   Explain the benefits (better model, segmented analysis).
    *   Clearly state the requirements (logic details, *historical AUM data*).
    *   Conclude with the value proposition.

9.  **Refine Language:** Use clear, concise terms. Ensure the distinction between the *static* Excel file and the *dynamic historical calculation* is obvious. Emphasize \"replicating logic historically\" and adding \"Historical_\" prefixes to the new features. Make the data requirement (especially AUM) prominent."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided explanation regarding the existing client classification system and the plan to integrate its logic into our churn project.

Here's my understanding and how I will incorporate this information:

1.  **Existing System:** There's an established Excel-based system that classifies clients (e.g., \"New,\" \"Classic,\" \"Silver,\" \"Gold,\" \"Platinum\") based on a weighted `Total Score`. This score is derived from components measuring Trading Days, AUM (Asset Under Management), Brokerage generated, and Recency of activity. The specific inputs, benchmarks, weights, and score-to-slab mappings are defined within that system (likely in the Excel file and its 'Algo' sheet).

2.  **Challenge - Lookahead Bias:** The current Excel file represents a static snapshot (e.g., classification as of Jan 31, 2025). Directly applying these static, future classifications to our historical ABT data (2021-2023) would constitute lookahead bias, rendering the model unrealistic and invalid.

3.  **Integration Strategy - Historical Replication:** The correct approach, as outlined, is to **replicate the classification logic historically within our ABT generation process (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`)**.
    *   For each client snapshot (combination of `CLIENTCODE` and `SnapshotDate` in our 2021-2023 data):
        *   We will gather the required input metrics (trade days, AUM, brokerage, recency dates) *as they existed at that specific `SnapshotDate`*.
        *   We will apply the scoring rules, weighting, and slab mapping logic (derived from the Excel system) to these historical metrics.
        *   This will generate *historical* scores (`Historical_Total_Score`, etc.) and a *historical* classification (`Historical_Slab` or `Historical_Tag`) for that client *at that point in time*.

4.  **New ABT Features:** The calculated `Historical_Total_Score` and `Historical_Slab` (or `Historical_Tag`) will be added as new columns (features) to our predictive ABT.

5.  **Benefits:**
    *   **Enhanced Model Features:** Incorporates established business logic and client value perception directly into the model's feature set.
    *   **Improved Analysis:** Enables segmentation analysis – we can investigate churn drivers and model performance specifically for clients who were historically classified as \"Gold,\" \"Silver,\" etc., providing valuable business insights beyond just the overall churn prediction.

6.  **Key Requirement:** The successful implementation hinges on having access to the necessary **historical underlying data points** for the entire 2021-2023 period, specifically:
    *   Historical Trade Counts (likely derivable from `trade_data.txt`).
    *   Historical Brokerage (derivable from `trade_data.txt`).
    *   Historical Activity Dates (derivable from `trade_data.txt`, `login_data_path`, `deposit_data.txt`, `payout_data.txt`).
    *   **Historical AUM:** This is crucial and might require a new data source or extraction if not already implicitly available in the current data. We need AUM values corresponding to each client and snapshot date.
    *   **Exact Logic:** We also need the precise formulas, benchmark values, weights, and score-to-slab mapping rules from the Excel system.

**How I will use this:**

*   **Memory:** I will store this integration plan, its rationale (avoiding lookahead bias), the proposed new features (`Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Slab`), and the critical data requirements (especially historical AUM and the classification logic details).
*   **ABT Generation:** When we revisit the `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` script, I will factor in the need to add steps for calculating these historical classification features, pending confirmation of data availability and the specific logic.
*   **Feature Engineering:** I will treat these historical classification features as potentially valuable inputs for the churn models.
*   **Analysis Phase:** I will remember the goal of performing segmented analysis based on these historical classifications once the models are built.

I understand the plan and its implications. I'm ready to assist with incorporating this logic into the PySpark script once the detailed rules and necessary historical data (particularly AUM) are available."""),

Logic: Calculates the number of days between LASTTRADEDATE (M4) and ACTIVATIONDATE (O4) if a LASTTRADEDATE exists (M4 > 0), otherwise returns 0. Represents active trading period.

E1 (Summary): =SUM(E4:E197215)

Logic: Sums Last 36 M DAYS TRADED for a large range of clients.

E2 (Summary): =COUNTIF($E$4:$E$1048576,\">0\")

Logic: Counts clients with Max 6/36 M Brok greater than 0.

U1 (Trading Days Score Parameter): =Algo!C4

Logic: Imports Weightage (220) for Trading Days from Algo sheet.

V1 (Trading Days Score Parameter): =Algo!C5

Logic: Imports Max Score (270) for Trading Days from Algo sheet.

T4 (Trading Days TARGET): =$E$1/$E$2

Logic: Calculates the average Last 36 M DAYS TRADED for clients who traded (>0), used as the target.

U4 (Trading Days ACHIEVEMENT): =E4/T4

Logic: Calculates the ratio of client's Last 36 M DAYS TRADED (E4) to the target average (T4).

V4 (Trading Days SCORE): =MIN(ROUND(U4*$U$1,0)+S4,$V$1)

Logic: Calculates score = ROUND(AchievementRatio * TradingDaysWeightage + StatusScore, 0), capped at TradingDaysMaxScore.

X1 (AUM Score Parameter): =Algo!D4

Logic: Imports Weightage (200) for AUM from Algo sheet.

Y4 (AUM SCORE): =ROUND(MIN(X4/W4*$X$1,$Y$1),0)

Logic: Calculates score = ROUND(MIN(NonNegativeAUM / AUMTarget * AUMWeightage, AUMMaxScore), 0). Note: Does not include Status Score here.

AA1 (Brokerage Score Parameter): =Algo!E4

Logic: Imports Weightage (300) for Brokerage from Algo sheet.

AB1 (Brokerage Score Parameter): =Algo!E5

Logic: Imports Max Score (350) for Brokerage from Algo sheet.

Z4 (Brokerage TARGET): =$J$1/$J$2

Logic: Calculates average Max 6/36 M Brok for clients with positive value, used as the target.

AA4 (Brokerage ACHIEVEMENT): =L4

Logic: Uses the client's BROKTILLDATE value directly as the achievement metric.

AB4 (Brokerage SCORE): =ROUND(MIN(AA4/Z4*$AA$1,$AB$1),0)

Logic: Calculates score = ROUND(MIN(BrokAchievement / BrokTarget * BrokWeightage, BrokMaxScore), 0).

AC4 (Recency TARGET): =Algo!$F$4/10

Logic: Calculates target = Algo!F4 (180) / 10 = 18.

AD4 (Recency ACHIEVEMENT): =MAX(180-($AE$1-MAX(M4,O4,P4,Q4)),0)

Logic: Calculates raw recency score = MAX(180 - (AnalysisDate - MostRecentActivityDate), 0). Most Recent Activity is MAX(LASTTRADEDATE, ACTIVATIONDATE, LastCashInDate, LastLoginDate).

AE4 (Recency SCORE): =MIN(AD4,180)

Logic: Caps the raw Recency score (AD4) at 180, matching the Max Score from the Algo sheet.

AF4 (TOTAL SCORE): =INT(AE4+AB4+Y4+V4)

Logic: Sums the scores for Recency (AE4), Brokerage (AB4), AUM (Y4), and Trading Days (V4), rounding down to the nearest integer.

AG4 (Slab): =VLOOKUP(AF4,$AL$5:$AM$9,2,1)

Logic: Performs an approximate lookup of the TOTAL SCORE (AF4) in the AL5:AM9 table to find the corresponding Category/Slab name.

AH4 (Score Slab): =IF($AE$1-O4>90,AG4,IF(AG4>450,AG4,\"-1\"))

Logic: If the client is older than 90 days since activation, the Score Slab is the same as the VLOOKUP Slab (AG4). If the client is 90 days or younger AND their VLOOKUP Slab (AG4) is <= \"Classic\" (potentially based on a numerical mapping >450 logic), the Score Slab is \"-1\", otherwise it's the VLOOKUP Slab (AG4).

AI4 (Tag): (Value is \"Gold\" in sample) - Appears to display the final assigned category, likely linked to the Score Slab (AH4).

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Here's a thinking process for responding to the user's request about incorporating the Excel classification logic:

1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The user wants to take the detailed explanation of an Excel-based client classification system (which we just analyzed in a previous hypothetical context) and apply it to the *actual* Religare churn prediction project we've been discussing.

2.  **Relate to Existing Project Context:** Connect this new requirement to the overall goal (churn prediction) and the current state (ABT generation using PySpark, data sources, churn definition).

3.  **Recall Key Integration Principle:** Remember the crucial point established earlier about *avoiding lookahead bias*. The Excel file represents a specific point in time (31-Jan-2025 in the example). Directly using its outputs (`Slab`, `Tag`) on historical data (2021-2023) is invalid. The *logic* must be replicated historically.

4.  **Map Excel Logic to ABT Generation:**
    *   **Inputs:** Identify the data points needed for the Excel formulas:
        *   `CLIENTCODE`, `ACTIVATIONDATE`, `LASTTRADEDATE`: Available from `client_details.txt`.
        *   `Last 36 M DAYS TRADED`, `36 M BROK`, `6 M Brok`, `BROKTILLDATE` (or equivalent total brokerage up to snapshot): Need to be calculated historically within PySpark based on `trade_data.txt` relative to each `SnapshotDate`.
        *   `AUM_AH_CUT`: This is the critical missing piece. Need historical AUM data. Assume for now it *might* become available or needs to be sourced.
        *   `Last Cash in Date`: Available from `deposit_data.txt`.
        *   `Last Login Date`: Available from `login_data_path`.
        *   `clientstatus`: May need clarification on source or if it's relevant/reproducible.
        *   `Status Score (S)`: Need definition/source. Is it related to `clientstatus`?
    *   **Parameters:** The fixed values from the \"Algo\" sheet (`Weightages`, `Max Scores`) and the main sheet (e.g., `AE1` analysis date - *this needs careful handling*) need to be incorporated into the PySpark logic.
    *   **Calculations:** Each Excel formula needs to be translated into PySpark DataFrame operations (using `withColumn`, window functions, UDFs if necessary).
    *   **Targets (Averages):** Formulas like `$E$1/$E$2`, `$G$1/$G$2`, `$J$1/$J$2` calculate averages across *all* clients *at the time of the Excel snapshot*. When calculating historically, should these targets be:
        *   Recalculated for *each* `SnapshotDate` based on the client population active/valid *at that snapshot*? (This seems most logically consistent for historical replication).
        *   Fixed based on the original Excel file's values? (Simpler, but less historically accurate). *Decision:* Assume recalculation per snapshot is preferred unless specified otherwise.
    *   **Analysis Date (`AE1`):** The `31-01-2025` date in the Recency calculation (`AD4`) is problematic for historical data. When calculating for a `SnapshotDate` in 2022, using a 2025 date makes no sense. The `AnalysisDate` for the historical calculation should likely be the `SnapshotDate` itself.
    *   **Lookup Table:** The `VLOOKUP` for `Slab` needs to be implemented in PySpark (e.g., using join or a series of `when`/`otherwise` conditions).
    *   **Final Logic (`AH4`, `AI4`):** The `IF` conditions for `Score Slab` and the `Tag` assignment need careful PySpark translation.

5.  **Structure the Integration Plan for PySpark:**
    *   **Phase:** Add this as a new step within the ABT generation script (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`), likely after calculating the base features (recency, frequency, monetary) but before the final filtering/saving.
    *   **Data Requirements:** Explicitly list the necessary input data, highlighting the need for historical AUM, clarification on `clientstatus`/`Status Score`, and the exact Excel logic/parameters.
    *   **Implementation Steps (Conceptual):**
        1.  Load necessary base data (trade, client, login, deposit, payout).
        2.  *If required:* Load historical AUM data and join it.
        3.  For each `SnapshotDate`:
            *   Calculate historical metrics relative to the `SnapshotDate` (e.g., trade days in last 36 months *ending* at `SnapshotDate`, brokerage in last 6/36 months *ending* at `SnapshotDate`, total brokerage *up to* `SnapshotDate`).
            *   Calculate historical target averages (e.g., average trade days, AUM, brokerage) based on the relevant client population *at that SnapshotDate*.
            *   Apply the scoring formulas using the historical metrics, historical targets, fixed weights/max scores from \"Algo\", and the `SnapshotDate` as the relevant analysis date for recency. *Need clarification on `Status Score (S)`*.
            *   Perform the score-to-slab lookup.
            *   Apply the final tag logic.
        4.  Add the calculated `Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Slab`, `Historical_Tag` columns to the ABT DataFrame.

6.  **Acknowledge Complexity and Dependencies:** State clearly that this adds significant complexity and depends heavily on data availability (AUM) and precise logic definition.

7.  **Formulate the Response:** Draft the response confirming understanding, outlining the plan to integrate this into the PySpark ABT generation, emphasizing the historical replication principle, detailing the required inputs and steps, and noting the dependencies/challenges. Use clear, structured language. Reiterate the goal: adding these historically relevant business classifications as features for the churn model."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, I understand. You want to take the detailed explanation of the client classification logic derived from the Excel file (which we analyzed conceptually) and apply it as a concrete step *within* our current Religare churn prediction project, specifically during the ABT generation phase (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`), before we proceed to model training (`Churn_Modeling.ipynb`).

This is an excellent idea, as incorporating established business logic historically can significantly enrich our feature set.

Here's the plan to integrate this historical classification logic into our ABT:

**1. Goal:**
To replicate the Excel-based scoring and classification logic (Trading Days, AUM, Brokerage, Recency -> Total Score -> Slab/Tag) *historically* for each client snapshot within our 2021-2023 ABT timeframe.

**2. Placement in Workflow:**
This logic will be added as a new section within the `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` script. It should run *after* the base features (recency, frequency, monetary sums over various lookbacks) have been calculated for each snapshot, as these base features will likely serve as inputs to the classification logic.

**3. Key Principle: Historical Replication (Avoiding Lookahead Bias):**
*   We **cannot** simply use the final scores/slabs from a static, future-dated Excel file.
*   For each `SnapshotDate` in our ABT (from 2021-01-01 to 2023-12-31):
    *   All input metrics (trade days, brokerage, AUM, activity dates) must reflect the client's status *as of that specific SnapshotDate*.
    *   The \"Analysis Date\" used in calculations (especially Recency) must be the `SnapshotDate` itself, not a fixed future date like `31-01-2025`.
    *   Targets based on population averages (e.g., avg. trade days, avg. AUM, avg. brokerage) should ideally be recalculated based on the relevant client population *at that SnapshotDate* to maintain historical context.

**4. Data Requirements & Potential Gaps:**
We need to ensure the following data is available historically and can be mapped to each `CLIENTCODE` and `SnapshotDate`:

*   **CLIENTCODE:** Available.
*   **ACTIVATIONDATE:** Available (`client_details.txt`).
*   **LASTTRADEDATE:** Available (calculable from `trade_data.txt`).
*   **Last 36 M DAYS TRADED:** Calculable from `trade_data.txt` relative to each `SnapshotDate`.
*   **36 M BROK:** Calculable from `trade_data.txt` relative to each `SnapshotDate`.
*   **6 M Brok:** Calculable from `trade_data.txt` relative to each `SnapshotDate`.
*   **AUM_AH_CUT (Historical):** **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT.** We need a source for historical AUM values per client, ideally aligned with our snapshot dates. *This is currently the biggest potential gap.*
*   **BROKTILLDATE:** This seems like cumulative brokerage up to the analysis date. We can calculate cumulative brokerage up to each `SnapshotDate` from `trade_data.txt`.
*   **Last Cash in Date:** Available (calculable from `deposit_data.txt`).
*   **Last Login Date:** Available (calculable from `login_data_path`).
*   **clientstatus (D):** Need source and definition. How is this determined historically?
*   **Status Score (S):** Need source and definition. How is this determined historically? Is it derived from `clientstatus`?
*   **Algo Sheet Parameters:** Weights (C4, D4, E4, F4) and Max Scores (C5, D5, E5, F5) - These are constants and can be hardcoded or read from a config.
*   **Slab Lookup Table (AL5:AM9+):** The score thresholds and category names - These are constants.

**5. Implementation Steps in PySpark (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`):**

*   **(After base feature calculation)** Define constants from the \"Algo\" sheet and the Slab lookup table.
*   **Calculate Historical Inputs:** Using window functions partitioned by `CLIENTCODE` and ordered by `SnapshotDate` (or date columns from source files), calculate:
    *   Trade days within the 36 months *preceding* `SnapshotDate`.
    *   Brokerage within the 6 and 36 months *preceding* `SnapshotDate`.
    *   Cumulative brokerage *up to* `SnapshotDate`.
    *   Most recent activity date (Trade, Login, Deposit) *up to* `SnapshotDate`.
    *   *(If AUM data is available)* Join historical AUM based on `CLIENTCODE` and `SnapshotDate`.
    *   *(If `clientstatus`/`Status Score` logic is known)* Calculate these historical values.
*   **Calculate Historical Targets:** For each `SnapshotDate`, calculate the average values (e.g., `Avg_36M_Trade_Days`, `Avg_AUM`, `Avg_Max_6_36_Brok`) across the relevant client population *at that time*. This might involve grouping by `SnapshotDate` after calculating individual metrics. Join these targets back to the main ABT DataFrame based on `SnapshotDate`.
*   **Calculate Score Components:** Translate each Excel SCORE formula (Trading Days, AUM, Brokerage, Recency) into PySpark `withColumn` operations:
    *   Use the calculated historical inputs.
    *   Use the calculated historical targets.
    *   Use the constants (Weights, Max Scores).
    *   Use `SnapshotDate` as the analysis date for Recency.
    *   Handle potential division by zero in target calculations or achievement ratios (e.g., using `when`/`otherwise` or `fillna(0)` appropriately).
    *   Apply `ROUND` and `MIN`/`MAX` functions as per the Excel logic.
*   **Calculate Total Score:** Sum the individual component scores (`withColumn`). Use `floor` or cast to integer for the `INT` function.
*   **Determine Slab/Tag:**
    *   Implement the `VLOOKUP` logic using `when`/`otherwise` conditions based on the `Historical_Total_Score` and the lookup table thresholds.
    *   Implement the conditional logic for `Score Slab` (checking age > 90 days from activation).
    *   Assign the final `Historical_Tag`.
*   **Add Features:** Ensure the new columns (`Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Slab`, `Historical_Tag`, potentially intermediate scores) are present in the final ABT DataFrame.

**6. Next Steps:**
1.  **Confirm Data Availability:** Prioritize confirming the source and format of historical AUM data.
2.  **Clarify Logic:** Get precise definitions for `clientstatus` and `Status Score (S)` and how they are determined historically.
3.  **Refine Target Calculation:** Decide definitively whether targets should be dynamic (recalculated per snapshot) or fixed (based on the original Excel file's values - less ideal but potentially simpler if dynamic is too complex). Dynamic is preferred for true historical replication.
4.  **Implement in PySpark:** Add the corresponding code blocks to `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`.

By following these steps, we can successfully integrate this valuable business context into our ABT, creating richer features for the churn prediction model. I'm ready to help implement this once the data requirements and logic clarifications are addressed."""),

The user said `clientstatus` is not needed, but maybe this `Status Score` is derived differently or comes from another source?). *Crucial point: Need clarification on the origin/calculation of `Status Score (S)` for historical replication.*

        *   `TARGET (Brokerage) (Z)`: 6,671.10 (Calculated as `J1/J2` -> `1213565807 / 181914` -> ~6671.1. Confirms formula).
        *   `ACHIEVEMENT (Brokerage) (AA)`: 14,38,419 (Directly from `L4` - BROKTILLDATE).
        *   `SCORE (Brokerage) (AB)`: 350 (Calculated as `ROUND(MIN(AA4/Z4 * AA1, AB1), 0)` -> `ROUND(MIN(1438419 / 6671.1 * 300, 350), 0)` -> `ROUND(MIN(215.6 * 300, 350), 0)` -> `ROUND(MIN(64680, 350), 0)` -> `ROUND(350, 0)` -> 350. Confirms formula and capping).

            *   `AE1 - MAX(...)` = `31-Jan-25 - 30-Jan-25` = 1 day.
            *   `180 - 1` = 179.
            *   `MAX(179, 0)` = 179. Confirms formula).

        *   `Slab (AG)`: 700 (Looks like `VLOOKUP(AF4, AL5:AM9, 2, 1)` -> `VLOOKUP(799, {..., 700:\"Gold\", 900:\"Platinum\"}, 2, 1)`. The lookup finds the largest value in the first column less than or equal to 799, which is 700. It should return \"Gold\". Why does it show 700? *Possible error in original summary or interpretation. The VLOOKUP should return the text slab.* Maybe the table has score thresholds in AL and numerical representations in AM? Let's re-check the VLOOKUP description. `VLOOKUP(AF4,$AL$5:$AM$9,2,1)`. If AL has scores (-1, 0, 450, 700, 900) and AM has text (\"New\", \"Classic\", \"Silver\", \"Gold\", \"Platinum\"), it should return \"Gold\". If AL has scores and AM has *numerical representation* (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), maybe that's it? But the example shows \"Gold\" in AI. This is confusing. Let's assume AG4 *should* result in \"Gold\" based on the logic). *Revisit this if implementing.* The value 700 shown in AG4 is the *threshold* score for Gold, not the result of the VLOOKUP returning column 2.
        *   `Score Slab (AH)`: 700 (Logic: `IF($AE$1-O4>90, AG4, IF(AG4>450, AG4, \"-1\"))`.
            *   `$AE$1-O4` = `31-Jan-25 - 09-Jun-14` = 3888 days (> 90).
            *   Condition is TRUE, so `AH4 = AG4`. Assuming `AG4` should be \"Gold\", then `AH4` should be \"Gold\". Why does it show 700? This reinforces the idea that `AG4` might be holding the threshold value instead of the slab name, or there's another lookup happening. Or maybe the `IF(AG4>450...)` logic is comparing the *threshold* value? Let's re-evaluate: IF(Age > 90, use Slab from AG4. IF Age <= 90, THEN IF Slab threshold (AG4?) > 450, use Slab from AG4, ELSE use \"-1\"). In this case, Age > 90, so `AH4` takes the value from `AG4`, which is shown as 700. This implies AG4 *is* holding the threshold value found by the VLOOKUP, not the slab name.
        *   `Tag (AI)`: Gold (This seems to be the final human-readable tag, likely derived from `AH4` (700) by looking up the slab name associated with the 700 threshold).

4.  **Synthesize & Update Plan:**
    *   Confirmation: The images confirm most of the previously discussed formulas and column meanings.
    *   `clientstatus`: Explicitly exclude from modeling features.
    *   `AUM_AH_CUT`: Still critical. Need historical source. The '-' value highlights that clients can have zero/missing AUM. The AUM score calculation correctly handles this (`MAX(G4,0)` and subsequent score becomes 0).
    *   `BROKTILLDATE`: Confirmed as the input for Brokerage Achievement (AA4). We can calculate this historically as cumulative brokerage up to `SnapshotDate`.
    *   `TARGET` Calculations: Confirmed to be based on SUM/COUNT aggregates (E1/E2, G1/G2, J1/J2). For historical replication:
        *   *Ideal:* Recalculate these SUMs and COUNTs based on the active population *at each SnapshotDate*. This requires aggregation over the relevant window.
        *   *Simpler alternative:* Use the fixed TARGET values (54.3, 258084, 6671.10) derived from the static Excel file. This introduces slight inaccuracy (using future averages on past data) but avoids complex snapshot-based aggregation. *Decision needed: Dynamic vs. Fixed Targets?* Given complexity, start with Fixed Targets and note it as a limitation/potential refinement.
    *   `Status Score (S)`: This is a **major unknown**. It's used in the Trading Days SCORE calculation (`V4 = MIN(ROUND(U4 * U1, 0) + S4, V1)`). We **must** determine how `S4` (value = 100 in example) is derived historically. Is it linked to tenure? Status? A fixed value? *Cannot replicate without this information.*
    *   `Slab (AG)` & `Score Slab (AH)`: The VLOOKUP seems to find the *threshold score* (e.g., 700) rather than the *name* (\"Gold\"). The `Score Slab` logic then uses this threshold. The final `Tag (AI)` column likely translates this numerical threshold back to the name.
        *   Implementation: The VLOOKUP needs to be adjusted in PySpark. Instead of returning the text name, it should return the threshold value from the lookup table's first column (`AL`). Use nested `when` conditions or a UDF with the threshold list.
        *   The `Score Slab (AH)` logic remains the same, comparing dates and using the threshold from `AG`.
        *   A final step is needed to map the `Score Slab (AH)` numerical threshold back to the `Tag (AI)` string name (e.g., 700 -> \"Gold\", 450 -> \"Silver\").
    *   `Analysis Date (AE1)`: Must be replaced with the dynamic `SnapshotDate` in historical calculations, especially for Recency (AD4).

5.  **Refined Integration Plan Summary:**
    *   Exclude `clientstatus`.
    *   Prioritize finding historical AUM source.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Determine the historical calculation/source for `Status Score (S)`.
    *   Decide on using Fixed TARGET values (from Excel) or Dynamic TARGET values (calculated per snapshot). Recommend starting with Fixed for simplicity.
    *   Implement historical calculations for inputs (Trade Days, Brokerage sums, Recency dates) relative to `SnapshotDate`.
    *   Implement scoring formulas in PySpark using historical inputs, `SnapshotDate` as analysis date, fixed targets (initially), known weights/max scores, and the *unknown* `Status Score`.
    *   Adjust VLOOKUP logic to return the score *threshold* (numeric) for `Historical_Slab_Threshold` (replaces AG concept).
    *   Implement `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold` logic (replaces AH concept).
    *   Add final step to map `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold` to `Historical_Tag` (string name, replaces AI concept).
    *   Add `Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold`, and `Historical_Tag` to the ABT.

6.  **Communicate:** Present the refined understanding and highlight the critical dependency on understanding the `Status Score (S)` calculation and securing historical AUM data. Confirm the decision on fixed vs. dynamic targets."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, thank you for providing the screenshots. They confirm many of the formulas and column definitions we discussed and introduce a few crucial details and clarifications.

Here's an updated understanding based on the images:

1.  **Confirmation of Formulas:** The examples shown align with the formulas we deduced for:
    *   `Max 6/36 M Brok (J)`
    *   `LifeTime (R)`
    *   `TARGET` calculations (T, W, Z) using SUM/COUNT from Rows 1 & 2.
    *   `ACHIEVEMENT` calculations (U, X, AA, AD)
    *   `SCORE` calculations (V, Y, AB, AE), including capping at Max Scores.
    *   `TOTAL SCORE (AF)` sum.

2.  **`clientstatus` (Column D):** You've confirmed this column (\"Active\" in the example) is **not needed** for the classification or prediction task. We will ignore it going forward for modeling.

3.  **`AUM_AH_CUT` (Column G):** The example shows '-' which confirms clients can have missing or zero AUM. The AUM Score calculation correctly results in 0 ('-') in this case. **Historical AUM data remains a critical requirement.**

4.  **`BROKTILLDATE` (Column L):** This is confirmed as the input for `Brokerage ACHIEVEMENT (AA4)`. We can calculate this historically as the cumulative brokerage sum up to the respective `SnapshotDate` in our ABT.

5.  **`TARGET` Calculations (Columns T, W, Z):**
    *   The values (54.3, 2,58,084, 6,671.10) are derived from the SUM/COUNT aggregates in rows 1 & 2 (e.g., `T4 = E1/E2`).
    *   **Decision for Historical Replication:**
        *   **Option A (More Accurate, More Complex):** Recalculate these SUM/COUNT values (and thus the TARGETs) dynamically based on the client population *at each `SnapshotDate`* in our ABT.
        *   **Option B (Simpler, Less Accurate):** Use the **fixed** TARGET values (54.3, 258084, 6671.10) from this specific Excel snapshot for all historical calculations. This assumes the overall population averages didn't change drastically over 2021-2023.
    *   **Recommendation:** Let's **start with Option B (Fixed Targets)** for simplicity and speed. We can note this as a potential area for refinement later if needed.

6.  **`Status Score` (Column S):**
    *   This column has a value of `100` for the example client.
    *   It is **used directly** in the `SCORE (Trading Days)` calculation: `V4 = MIN(ROUND(U4 * U1, 0) + S4, V1)`.
    *   **CRITICAL UNKNOWN:** We need to know how this `Status Score (S)` is determined. Is it fixed? Based on tenure (`LifeTime`)? Based on the (now excluded) `clientstatus`? Derived from some other logic or data source? **We cannot replicate the Trading Days Score without knowing how to calculate or assign the `Status Score` historically.**

7.  **`Slab` (AG), `Score Slab` (AH), `Tag` (AI):**
    *   My previous interpretation of the VLOOKUP needs correction based on the example values.
    *   `AG4 (Slab)` shows `700`. This is the *threshold score* for the \"Gold\" category found via the approximate VLOOKUP on the `TOTAL SCORE (AF4 = 799)`. The `VLOOKUP(799, table, 2, 1)` finds the row where the score is >= 700 but < 900, and instead of returning the text \"Gold\", it seems to be returning the threshold value (700) itself. Or maybe the lookup table in `AL:AM` has thresholds in AL and *numeric thresholds again* in AM? Regardless, the result `700` is used.
    *   `AH4 (Score Slab)` also shows `700`. The logic `IF(Age > 90 days, AG4, ...)` evaluates to TRUE (client is old), so `AH4 = AG4`, resulting in `700`.
    *   `AI4 (Tag)` shows \"Gold\". This indicates a final step where the numeric threshold value in `AH4` (700) is mapped back to its corresponding text label (\"Gold\").
    *   **Implementation Adjustment:**
        *   When implementing the VLOOKUP in PySpark, we'll use nested `when` conditions based on `Historical_Total_Score` to determine the correct numeric *threshold* (e.g., -1, 0, 450, 700, 900). This value will be stored in a column like `Historical_Slab_Threshold`.
        *   The logic for `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold` (based on age and `Historical_Slab_Threshold`) remains conceptually the same, using the numeric threshold.
        *   Add a final mapping step (using `when` conditions) to convert the `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold` value into the final `Historical_Tag` string (\"New\", \"Classic\", \"Silver\", \"Gold\", \"Platinum\").

8.  **`Analysis Date` (Cell AE1):** Confirmed as `31-Jan-25` in the Excel file. For historical replication, **this MUST be replaced by the dynamic `SnapshotDate`** from our ABT in all relevant calculations (especially Recency).

**Revised Plan Summary & Action Items:**

1.  **Confirm Data/Logic:**
    *   **Priority 1:** Determine the source/logic for calculating the `Status Score (S)` historically. **(BLOCKER)**
    *   **Priority 2:** Confirm the availability and format of historical `AUM_AH_CUT` data. **(BLOCKER)**
    *   **Confirm Decision:** Use Fixed TARGET values (54.3, 258084, 6671.10) for the initial implementation. (Assumption: Yes)
2.  **PySpark Implementation Steps (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`):**
    *   Exclude `clientstatus`.
    *   Define constants (Weights, Max Scores, Fixed Targets, Slab Thresholds/Names).
    *   Calculate historical base inputs (trade days, brokerage sums, recency dates, cumulative brokerage (`BROKTILLDATE` equivalent)) relative to each `SnapshotDate`.
    *   *\\[Once Blockers Resolved]* Calculate historical `Status Score (S)`.
    *   *\\[Once Blockers Resolved]* Join historical `AUM_AH_CUT`.
    *   Calculate historical score components (Trading Days, AUM, Brokerage, Recency) using historical inputs, `SnapshotDate` as analysis date, fixed targets, and historical `Status Score`. Handle potential nulls/zeros (esp. AUM).
    *   Calculate `Historical_Total_Score`.
    *   Calculate `Historical_Slab_Threshold` (numeric threshold via VLOOKUP logic).
    *   Calculate `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold` (using age logic).
    *   Calculate `Historical_Tag` (string name mapped from `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold`).
    *   Add `Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold`, and `Historical_Tag` as features to the ABT.

2.  **Recall the Classification Logic:** Mentally (or by reviewing the previous messages/compiled list), reconstruct the flow:
    *   **Inputs:** `CLIENTCODE`, `ACTIVATIONDATE`, `Last 36 M DAYS TRADED`, `36 M BROK`, `AUM_AH_CUT`, `6 M Brok`, `BROKTILLDATE`, `LASTTRADEDATE`, `Last Cash in Date`, `Last Login Date`, `Status Score`.
    *   **Parameters:** Weights, Max Scores (from \"Algo\"), Analysis Date (`SnapshotDate`), Population Targets (Avg Trade Days, Avg AUM, Avg Brokerage), Slab Thresholds/Names.
    *   **Calculations:**
        *   `LifeTime`
        *   `Max 6/36 M Brok`
        *   Component `TARGET`s (using population averages - fixed or dynamic?)
        *   Component `ACHIEVEMENT`s (using client inputs and targets)
        *   Recency Achievement (`AD4` formula)
        *   Component `SCORE`s (using achievement, weights, *Status Score* for Trading Days, max scores)
        *   `TOTAL SCORE` (sum of component scores)
        *   `Slab` / `Score Slab` / `Tag` (using Total Score, lookup logic, activation age check)
    *   **Output Features:** `Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold`, `Historical_Tag`.

3.  **Map Logic to Available ABT Data:** Review the data sources we *already* plan to use for the ABT (`client_details.txt`, `trade_data.txt`, `deposit_data.txt`, `payout_data.txt`, `login_data_path`).
    *   Can we get `CLIENTCODE`? Yes.
    *   Can we get `ACTIVATIONDATE`? Yes (`client_details.txt`).
    *   Can we calculate `Last 36 M DAYS TRADED` historically? Yes (from `trade_data.txt` relative to `SnapshotDate`).
    *   Can we calculate `36 M BROK` historically? Yes (from `trade_data.txt` relative to `SnapshotDate`).
    *   Can we calculate `6 M Brok` historically? Yes (from `trade_data.txt` relative to `SnapshotDate`).
    *   Can we calculate `BROKTILLDATE` (cumulative brokerage) historically? Yes (from `trade_data.txt` relative to `SnapshotDate`).
    *   Can we calculate `LASTTRADEDATE` historically? Yes (from `trade_data.txt` relative to `SnapshotDate`).
    *   Can we calculate `Last Cash in Date` historically? Yes (from `deposit_data.txt` relative to `SnapshotDate`).
    *   Can we calculate `Last Login Date` historically? Yes (from `login_data_path` relative to `SnapshotDate`).
    *   Can we get `AUM_AH_CUT` historically? **No, not from current sources.** -> *Requirement 1*
    *   Can we get `Status Score` historically? **No, source/logic unknown.** -> *Requirement 2*

4.  **Review Parameters & Logic Decisions:**
    *   Weights & Max Scores: Known (from \"Algo\" sheet analysis). -> *OK*
    *   Analysis Date: Will use dynamic `SnapshotDate`. -> *OK*
    *   Population Targets: Decided to use *fixed* values initially (54.3, 258084, 6671.10). -> *Decision Confirmed, Need Value Confirmation* -> *Requirement 3*
    *   Slab Thresholds/Names: Known (from lookup table analysis). -> *OK*
    *   VLOOKUP/Slab/Tag Logic: Understood based on example, requires implementation with `when` clauses. -> *OK*
    *   `clientstatus`: Explicitly excluded by user. -> *OK*

5.  **Synthesize Missing Pieces:** Based on steps 3 & 4, list the absolute blockers and necessary clarifications.

    *   **Blocker 1:** Historical AUM Data (`AUM_AH_CUT`). Need the source and format.
    *   **Blocker 2:** Logic for `Status Score (S)`. How is it determined historically?
    *   **Clarification 1:** Confirm the *exact fixed values* to use for the TARGETs (Trading Days, AUM, Brokerage) if we stick with the fixed approach. Are 54.3, 258084, 6671.10 the definitive values?
    *   *(Self-Correction/Refinement):* While we know the *structure* of the Slab lookup (thresholds/names), it's good practice to explicitly list the exact pairs we'll implement. -> *Requirement 4*

6.  **Structure the Answer:** Present the list clearly, separating critical blockers from confirmations/minor details. Explain *why* each piece is needed in relation to the classification calculation. Reiterate the goal (implementing historical classification in the ABT).

7.  **Review:** Read through the generated list. Does it cover all the unknowns identified? Is it clear? Does it directly answer the user's question (\"what more information do we need?\")? Yes."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, based on our analysis of the Excel classification logic and the goal of replicating it historically within our ABT generation process, here's exactly what we still need before we can proceed with coding that specific part:

**Critical Missing Information (Blockers):**

1.  **Historical AUM Data (`AUM_AH_CUT`):**
    *   **What:** We need the actual Asset Under Management value for each client (`CLIENTCODE`) corresponding to each potential `SnapshotDate` within our 2021-2023 timeframe.
    *   **Why:** AUM is a direct input to the `AUM Achievement (X)` and `AUM Score (Y)` calculations, which contribute to the `Total Score`. Without historical AUM, we cannot calculate these components accurately for past snapshots.
    *   **Needed Format:** Ideally, a data source (like another TXT file) that maps `CLIENTCODE`, a `Date`, and the corresponding `AUM` value.

2.  **Logic/Source for `Status Score (S)`:**
    *   **What:** We need to know how the value in the `Status Score` column (which was `100` in the example) is determined for each client, historically.
    *   **Why:** This score is directly added into the `Trading Days Score (V)` calculation (`MIN(ROUND(U4 * U1, 0) + S4, V1)`). Without knowing how to calculate or look up this `Status Score` for each client snapshot, the Trading Days Score (and thus the Total Score) will be incorrect.
    *   **Possible Scenarios:** Is it a fixed value for all active clients? Does it depend on tenure (`LifeTime`)? Is it derived from some other client attribute or activity metric? We need the specific rule.

**Confirmations & Minor Details Needed:**

3.  **Confirmation of Fixed TARGET Values:**
    *   **What:** We tentatively decided to use fixed population average TARGETs instead of dynamically recalculating them for each snapshot. We need to confirm if the values derived from Rows 1 & 2 in the provided snapshot are the correct ones to use throughout 2021-2023:
        *   Trading Days TARGET (`T4` logic): `54.3` (derived from `E1/E2`)
        *   AUM TARGET (`W4` logic): `2,58,084` (derived from `G1/G2`)
        *   Brokerage TARGET (`Z4` logic): `6,671.10` (derived from `J1/J2`)
    *   **Why:** These values are divisors or multipliers in the Achievement and Score calculations. Using the wrong baseline target will skew the scores.

4.  **Exact Slab Lookup Table Values:**
    *   **What:** Just to be precise for implementation, please confirm the exact Score Threshold -> Category Name mapping. Based on the analysis, it seems to be:
        *   -1 -> \"New\"
        *   0 -> \"Classic\"
        *   450 -> \"Silver\"
        *   700 -> \"Gold\"
        *   900 -> \"Platinum\"
        *   (Potentially 1100 -> \"Platinum +\", if applicable)
    *   **Why:** We need these exact pairs to correctly implement the final `VLOOKUP`-like logic in PySpark using `when` conditions to assign the `Historical_Tag`.

Once we have the **Historical AUM data (1)** and the **logic for Status Score (2)**, and confirm the **Fixed Targets (3)** and **Slab Mapping (4)**, we will have all the necessary components to write the PySpark code to calculate `Historical_Total_Score` and `Historical_Tag` for each client snapshot within the `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` script."""),

 I understand your question regarding the TARGET values for the Trading Days, AUM, and Brokerage parameters.
Based on the formulas you provided and our previous discussion:
Where the values (54.3, 2,58,084, 6,671.10) come from: You are correct. These specific numerical values are the result of the summary formulas in E1/E2, G1/G2, and J1/J2 as calculated on the specific dataset shown in the snapshot you provided (the data starting from Row 4 in that moment). These formulas dynamically calculate population averages based on the data currently loaded into the sheet.
How the sheet currently works: The formulas for T4 (=$E$1/$E$2), W4 (=$G$1/$G$2), and Z4 (=$J$1/$J$2) do not contain fixed numbers like 54.3 or 2,58,084 directly. Instead, they reference the cells (E1, E2, G1, G2, J1, J2) that contain the results of the dynamic average calculations from the currently loaded data (Rows 4 onwards).
Confirmation regarding your goal (using fixed targets for 2021-2023):
If your goal is to use the specific values 54.3, 2,58,084, and 6,671.10 as the fixed TARGETs for the respective parameters when analyzing data from different time periods (like 2021-2023 data which would replace the current data in Rows 4+), then the current formulas in T4, W4, and Z4 will not automatically use these fixed values.
The current formulas will recalculate the targets based on the averages of the 2021 or 2023 data that you load into the sheet at that time.
To use fixed targets of 54.3, 2,58,084, and 6,671.10 for analysis across 2021-2023 datasets, you would need to modify the formulas in T4, W4, and Z4 (and likely the corresponding cells in subsequent rows like T5, W5, Z5 etc., probably via dragging the formula down) to directly reference cells containing these fixed numbers, or potentially hardcode the numbers (though referencing cells is better practice).
In summary: The values you listed are indeed the targets calculated from the specific data snapshot you showed. However, the Excel file as currently formulated does not use these values as fixed constants; it calculates targets dynamically based on the dataset present. If you intend to use these specific values as fixed targets for analysis across different time periods like 2021-2023, the formulas in the TARGET columns (T, W, Z) would need to be changed.

Exact Slab Lookup Table Values: These are indeed the exact numerical thresholds and the corresponding category names that your VLOOKUP formula (and your intended PySpark logic) should use to translate the total score into an initial category assignment (Slab)."""),

1.  **Identify the Core Goal:** The user wants to proceed with implementing the historical classification logic in the PySpark ABT script. They've provided some critical missing pieces and asked for confirmation on the TARGET value approach.

2.  **Process New Information:**
    *   **Historical AUM:** User confirms they *will* provide this. Acknowledge this and reiterate its importance. Note that implementation depends on receiving it.
    *   **Status Score (S):** User clarifies it's a FIXED value of `100` for all clients. This is a major simplification and resolves a blocker. Note this down as a fixed constant for the PySpark code.
    *   **TARGET Values:** The user provides a detailed explanation clarifying that the Excel sheet *dynamically* calculates TARGETs based on the loaded data (using SUM/COUNT in rows 1 & 2), but confirms *their goal* is to use the *specific values* (54.3, 258084, 6671.10) derived from the *snapshot* as **fixed constants** for the historical 2021-2023 analysis. This resolves the ambiguity. We will hardcode these specific numbers in the PySpark script.
    *   **Slab Lookup:** User confirms the provided threshold-to-name mapping is correct. Note these pairs for implementation.

3.  **Synthesize and Structure the Response:** Start by clearly stating understanding and acknowledging the new information.

4.  **Address Each Point Systematically:**
    *   **AUM:** \"Okay, great! We'll await the historical AUM data. Implementation of the AUM score component depends on this.\"
    *   **Status Score:** \"Excellent, Status Score = 100 (fixed) simplifies things significantly. We will use this constant in the Trading Days Score calculation.\"
    *   **TARGET Values:** This requires careful wording.
        *   Acknowledge the user's explanation of the Excel's *dynamic* nature.
        *   Explicitly confirm understanding of the *decision* to use *fixed* values for the historical analysis.
        *   List the specific fixed values we will use:
            *   `Fixed_Target_TradingDays = 54.3`
            *   `Fixed_Target_AUM = 258084.0` (use float for consistency)
            *   `Fixed_Target_Brokerage = 6671.10`
        *   Mention *why* this is being done (simplicity, avoids recalculating dynamic averages per snapshot for now).
    *   **Slab Lookup:** \"Confirmed. We will use the following mapping for the final tag assignment:\" List the threshold-name pairs clearly.

5.  **Check for Remaining Blockers/Dependencies:** With the Status Score clarified and the TARGET approach decided, the *only* remaining blocker before coding this specific classification logic is receiving the **Historical AUM data**. State this clearly.

6.  **Outline the Next Steps (Implementation Plan):** Reiterate the plan for adding this logic into the PySpark script (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`). Briefly list the sequence of calculations again, incorporating the newly clarified fixed values:
    *   Define constants (Weights, Max Scores, *Fixed* Targets, Status Score=100, Slab Mapping).
    *   Calculate historical base inputs (Trade Days, Brokerage, Recency Dates, Cumulative Brokerage).
    *   *Wait for AUM data* -> Join historical AUM.
    *   Calculate Score Components (using historical inputs, `SnapshotDate`, *fixed* targets, fixed Status Score=100).
    *   Calculate Total Score.
    *   Calculate Slab Threshold & Tag (using confirmed mapping).
    *   Add features to ABT.

7.  **Concluding Remark:** Express readiness to proceed with implementation once the AUM data is available.

8.  **Review and Refine:** Read through the response. Is it clear? Does it accurately reflect the decisions? Is the remaining dependency explicit? Ensure the tone is collaborative and confirms understanding. Make sure the fixed TARGET values are listed correctly. Add precision (e.g., use floats for targets)."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, fantastic! This clarifies the remaining major unknowns.

Here's a summary of our confirmed understanding and the plan moving forward:

**Confirmed Inputs & Logic:**

1.  **Historical AUM Data (`AUM_AH_CUT`):** You will provide this data. We will need it before implementing the AUM score component.
2.  **`Status Score (S)`:** This will be a **fixed constant value of `100`** for all clients in all historical snapshots. This significantly simplifies the `Trading Days Score` calculation.
3.  **TARGET Values (for T4, W4, Z4 logic):** We will use **fixed constant values** derived from the provided snapshot for the entire 2021-2023 historical analysis. We understand the Excel file calculates these dynamically, but for our historical ABT, we will use:
    *   `Fixed_Target_TradingDays = 54.3`
    *   `Fixed_Target_AUM = 258084.0` (Using float for consistency)
    *   `Fixed_Target_Brokerage = 6671.10`
4.  **Slab Lookup Table Values:** Confirmed. The mapping from `Historical_Total_Score` to `Historical_Tag` will use these thresholds:
    *   Score >= 900 -> \"Platinum\" (Assuming we cap here, or need the 1100 threshold if \"Platinum +\" exists)
    *   Score >= 700 -> \"Gold\"
    *   Score >= 450 -> \"Silver\"
    *   Score >= 0 -> \"Classic\"
    *   Score = -1 -> \"New\" (This needs slight clarification - does Total Score actually become -1, or is this handled by the `Score Slab` age logic? Let's assume for now the VLOOKUP part handles scores >= 0, and the \"New\" tag might come from the age-based `Score Slab` logic if the initial score is low.) *Self-correction: The VLOOKUP uses approximate match (TRUE/1), so any score < 0 might map to \"New\" if -1 is the lowest threshold, and scores between 0 and 449 map to \"Classic\". We'll implement based on this.* The age check logic in `Score Slab` (`AH4`) adds another layer.

**Readiness to Proceed:**

*   We now have **almost all** the necessary information to code the historical classification logic within the `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` script.
*   The **only remaining dependency** is receiving the **Historical AUM data**.

**Next Steps (Implementation in PySpark):**

1.  **Receive Historical AUM Data:** You will provide this (e.g., as a TXT/CSV file with `CLIENTCODE`, `Date`, `AUM_Value`).
2.  **Load AUM Data:** Add steps in the PySpark script to load this new AUM data source.
3.  **Implement Classification Logic (New Section in `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`):**
    *   Define constants: Weights, Max Scores, Fixed Targets (54.3, 258084.0, 6671.10), Status Score (100), Slab thresholds/names.
    *   Calculate historical base inputs (Trade Days, Brokerage, Recency Dates, Cumulative Brokerage) relative to each `SnapshotDate` (as already planned).
    *   Join the historical AUM data to the main ABT dataframe based on `CLIENTCODE` and `SnapshotDate`. Handle cases where AUM might be missing for a specific snapshot (treat as 0 for calculations based on `MAX(G4,0)` logic).
    *   Calculate `Historical_Trading_Days_Score` using historical inputs, `Fixed_Target_TradingDays`, Weightage, Max Score, and the fixed `Status_Score=100`.
    *   Calculate `Historical_AUM_Score` using historical AUM, `Fixed_Target_AUM`, Weightage, and Max Score.
    *   Calculate `Historical_Brokerage_Score` using historical cumulative brokerage (`BROKTILLDATE` equivalent), `Fixed_Target_Brokerage`, Weightage, and Max Score.
    *   Calculate `Historical_Recency_Score` using historical activity dates, `SnapshotDate` as the analysis date, and the Recency Weightage/Benchmark (180).
    *   Calculate `Historical_Total_Score` by summing the four component scores.
    *   Determine `Historical_Slab_Threshold` using nested `when` conditions mimicking the approximate VLOOKUP based on `Historical_Total_Score` and the confirmed thresholds (0, 450, 700, 900).
    *   Calculate client age relative to `SnapshotDate` (`SnapshotDate - ACTIVATIONDATE`).
    *   Determine `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold` using the IF(Age > 90, `Historical_Slab_Threshold`, IF(`Historical_Slab_Threshold` <= 0 [Classic/New], -1, `Historical_Slab_Threshold`)) logic - *Refining interpretation of `IF(AG4>450,AG4,\"-1\")`. It seems if young AND score maps to Silver/Gold/Platinum (threshold > 0, maybe > 450?), keep that threshold, otherwise map to -1. Let's re-verify this specific AH4 logic detail if possible, but proceed with this interpretation for now: If Age <= 90 AND `Historical_Slab_Threshold` <= 0, map to -1, otherwise use `Historical_Slab_Threshold`.*
    *   Determine final `Historical_Tag` by mapping `Historical_Score_Slab_Threshold` back to names (\"New\", \"Classic\", \"Silver\", \"Gold\", \"Platinum\").
    *   Add `Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Tag` (and potentially intermediate scores/thresholds if useful) to the final ABT select list.

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Here's a thinking process for determining the best format for historical AUM data:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The purpose of the historical AUM data is to calculate the `AUM Score` component for *each client snapshot* in our ABT. The ABT covers the period 2021-01-01 to 2023-12-31, likely with monthly snapshots.

2.  **Recall the Calculation:** The AUM Score calculation (`Y4` logic) uses `AUM_AH_CUT` (`X4 = MAX(G4, 0)`) relative to a target (`W4`). This means for a snapshot taken on, say, `2022-05-31`, we need the client's AUM *as close as possible to that date*.

3.  **Evaluate \"Yearwise\" AUM:**
    *   **What it means:** A single AUM value per client per year (e.g., AUM as of Dec 31st, 2021; Dec 31st, 2022; Dec 31st, 2023).
    *   **Pros:** Simpler data structure, likely easier to extract or obtain.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   **Staleness:** If we have monthly snapshots in our ABT, using a year-end AUM value for a snapshot taken in January or February of that year might be very inaccurate. A client's AUM can fluctuate significantly within a year due to market movements, deposits, or withdrawals.
        *   **Misalignment:** The AUM score calculated for `2022-01-31` would use the AUM from `2021-12-31` (or maybe `2022-12-31` depending on logic), which doesn't reflect the *current* AUM contribution to their potential classification at that specific snapshot time.
        *   **Bias:** It might incorrectly classify clients based on outdated AUM information relative to the snapshot date.

4.  **Evaluate \"Monthly\" AUM:**
    *   **What it means:** An AUM value per client per month (e.g., AUM as of Jan 31st, 2021; Feb 28th, 2021; ... Dec 31st, 2023).
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **Timeliness:** Provides a much more accurate AUM value corresponding closely to the likely monthly snapshot dates in the ABT.
        *   **Better Alignment:** The AUM score calculated for `2022-05-31` would use the AUM value from `2022-05-31`, leading to a more historically accurate classification.
    *   **Cons:** Larger data file, potentially more complex to extract from the source system.

5.  **Evaluate \"Daily\" AUM:**
    *   **What it means:** An AUM value per client per day.
    *   **Pros:** Most accurate possible alignment.
    *   **Cons:** Likely infeasible to extract/store/process. Massive data volume. Overkill given the ABT snapshot frequency is likely monthly.

6.  **Consider the ABT Snapshot Frequency:** The ABT generation script (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`) uses `generate_snapshots` likely creating monthly snapshots (e.g., end-of-month).

7.  **Determine the Best Fit:** Monthly AUM aligns best with the likely monthly snapshot frequency of the ABT. It provides a good balance between accuracy (timeliness) and feasibility (data volume/extraction effort). Yearwise AUM is too coarse and would introduce significant staleness into the AUM score calculation for most snapshots within a year.

8.  **Define the Ideal Format:**
    *   Columns: `CLIENTCODE`, `AUM_Date`, `AUM_Value`.
    *   Frequency: One record per client per month, ideally reflecting the AUM as of the *end* of that month (e.g., `2021-01-31`, `2021-02-28`, etc.) to match the ABT snapshots.
    *   Format: A delimited text file (like the other inputs) is preferred for PySpark loading (e.g., CSV or pipe-delimited).

9.  **Consider Fallbacks/Alternatives:** If monthly is absolutely impossible:
    *   **Quarterly:** Better than yearly, but still has staleness issues.
    *   **Yearly:** Acceptable *only* if it's the *only* option available, but acknowledge the significant limitation/inaccuracy introduced. Explain *why* monthly is preferred.
    *   **If only *current* AUM is available:** Explain that we cannot accurately calculate historical classifications and would have to omit the AUM score component or make very strong (likely incorrect) assumptions.

10. **Formulate the Recommendation:** Recommend monthly AUM data, specifying the ideal format (columns, frequency, file type). Explain *why* it's better than yearly (alignment with snapshots, timeliness). If monthly isn't possible, ask for the best available frequency (quarterly?) while highlighting the drawbacks of less frequent data."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, let's think about how the AUM value will be used.

Our ABT (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`) creates snapshots of clients at different points in time between 2021-01-01 and 2023-12-31. It's likely generating these snapshots on a **monthly basis** (e.g., end of Jan 2021, end of Feb 2021, etc.).

The goal is to calculate the `Historical_AUM_Score` for each client *at each specific SnapshotDate*. This score depends directly on the client's AUM at that time.

**Why Year-wise AUM might be problematic:**

*   If we only have AUM as of Dec 31st, 2021, Dec 31st, 2022, etc., what AUM value do we use for a snapshot taken on May 31st, 2022?
*   Using the Dec 31st, 2021 value would be very outdated (5 months old).
*   Using the Dec 31st, 2022 value would be looking into the future (7 months ahead).
*   A client's AUM can change significantly within a year due to market fluctuations, deposits, or withdrawals. Using a year-end value for all snapshots within that year doesn't accurately reflect their status at the time of the snapshot.

**Why Monthly AUM is much better:**

*   If we have AUM as of the end of each month (Jan 31st, 2021; Feb 28th, 2021; ... Dec 31st, 2023), it aligns perfectly with our likely monthly snapshot frequency.
*   For the snapshot taken on May 31st, 2022, we can use the actual AUM value from May 31st, 2022.
*   This leads to a much more accurate historical calculation of the AUM Score and the resulting client classification (`Historical_Tag`) for each specific point in time.

**Recommendation:**

The **ideal format** would be **monthly AUM data**.

A simple text file (e.g., `historical_aum.txt`, CSV or pipe-delimited) with columns like:

`CLIENTCODE | AUM_Date | AUM_Value`

Where:

*   `CLIENTCODE`: Matches the client identifier in our other files.
*   `AUM_Date`: Represents the date the AUM was recorded, ideally the **end of each month** (e.g., `2021-01-31`, `2021-02-28`, `2021-03-31`, ..., `2023-12-31`). The date format should be consistent (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).
*   `AUM_Value`: The actual Asset Under Management numerical value for that client on that date.

2.  **Context:** The AUM data is needed to calculate the `Historical_AUM_Score` for each client snapshot in the ABT.
3.  **ABT Timeframe:** The main ABT covers snapshots from `2021-01-01` to `2023-12-31`.
4.  **AUM Calculation:** The `AUM Score` uses the `AUM_AH_CUT` value *at the time of the snapshot*.
5.  **Snapshot Dates:** We are likely creating snapshots at the end of each month within the ABT timeframe. So, the latest snapshot date requiring AUM will be around `2023-12-31`. The earliest will be around `2021-01-31`.
6.  **Lookback:** Does the AUM score calculation itself require any lookback period *for AUM*? Reviewing the formulas:
    *   `X4 (AUM ACHIEVEMENT): =MAX(G4,0)` - Uses the AUM value (`G4` = `AUM_AH_CUT`) directly at that point in time.
    *   `Y4 (AUM SCORE): =ROUND(MIN(X4/W4*$X$1,$Y$1),0)` - Uses the Achievement (X4), the Target (W4 - based on average *current* AUM), the Weightage (X1), and the Max Score (Y1).
    *   **Conclusion:** The AUM score calculation only needs the AUM value *as of the snapshot date*. No lookback period for AUM itself is needed for the score calculation.
7.  **Required Range:** Therefore, we need the AUM values that correspond directly to the snapshot dates we are generating. Since the snapshots span from Jan 2021 to Dec 2023, we need AUM data covering this entire period.
8.  **Frequency:** As discussed, monthly frequency is best.
9.  **Specific Dates:** If snapshots are end-of-month, we need AUM data for `2021-01-31`, `2021-02-28`, ..., `2023-11-30`, `2023-12-31`.
10. **Slight Buffer?** Is there any edge case? The other scores (Trading Days, Brokerage) use lookbacks (36M, 6M). The Recency score uses the latest activity date up to the snapshot. But AUM itself seems point-in-time. So, no buffer seems strictly necessary *before* Jan 2021 for the calculation itself.

        *   If Dormant AND `FIRSTTRADEDATE` exists (meaning they traded at least once in the past), `Status Score` = 75.

2.  **Recall Previous Decisions:**
    *   We decided to **ignore** the `clientstatus` column (Column D) because the user initially said it wasn't needed for prediction or classification.
    *   The Excel snapshot showed `clientstatus` = \"Active\".
    *   The *new* logic for `Status Score` explicitly *depends* on whether the client is \"Active\" or \"Dormant\".

3.  **Identify the Conflict/Problem:** The new `Status Score` logic directly contradicts the decision to ignore the `clientstatus`. We *now* need to know the client's status (\"Active\" or \"Dormant\") *historically* for each snapshot to calculate the `Status Score` correctly.

4.  **Determine Historical Status:**
    *   How is \"Active\" vs. \"Dormant\" defined *historically* within the context of the Religare system or this specific classification scheme?
    *   Is it based on the `clientstatus` column (D) directly from some source system as of that snapshot date?
    *   Is it based on recent activity (e.g., trade/login/funding within the last X months prior to the snapshot)? *This seems more likely for a dynamic historical status.*
    *   Is it based on the official `Dormancy_Date` we previously excluded? (If so, we need to reconsider using it, at least for this specific calculation).

5.  **Evaluate Impact on Plan:**
    *   The core plan to replicate the classification logic historically remains valid.
    *   However, we have a **new blocker**: Defining and obtaining the historical \"Active\" / \"Dormant\" status for each client snapshot.
    *   We still need the historical AUM data.
    *   The rest of the confirmed logic (Fixed Targets, Slab Mapping) remains unchanged.

6.  **Formulate Response:**
    *   Acknowledge the updated `Status Score` logic.
    *   Explain clearly that this new logic makes the client's \"Active\" or \"Dormant\" status *essential*.
    *   State that this contradicts the earlier decision to ignore `clientstatus`.
    *   Ask the user *how* this \"Active\" / \"Dormant\" status should be determined for each historical snapshot date (2021-2023). Provide options:
        *   Is there a historical `clientstatus` column available?
        *   Should we define it based on activity (e.g., any trade/login/funding in the last 6/12 months before the snapshot)? Specify the rule/lookback period.
        *   Should we use the official (previously excluded) `Dormancy_Date`?

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, thank you for the correction regarding the `Status Score (S)`. This adds a bit more complexity back in. Let's break it down:

**Revised Status Score (S) Logic:**

*   **If Client is \"Active\":** `Status Score = 100`
*   **If Client is \"Dormant\":** `Status Score = IF(FIRSTTRADEDATE is null/zero, 0, 75)`
    *   Means: Dormant & Never Traded -> Score = 0
    *   Means: Dormant & Previously Traded -> Score = 75

**Impact on Previous Plan:**

This revised logic introduces a **critical dependency** that clashes with our earlier decision:

1.  **We Need Historical Client Status:** The calculation *now requires* us to know whether a client was considered \"Active\" or \"Dormant\" *at the time of each historical snapshot* (for every `SnapshotDate` between 2021-01-01 and 2023-12-31).
2.  **Contradiction:** Previously, we decided to ignore the `clientstatus` column (Column D) based on the input that it wasn't needed. However, this new logic for `Status Score` makes that status essential.

**New Question We Must Answer:**

How do we determine if a client was \"Active\" or \"Dormant\" for a specific historical `SnapshotDate` in our ABT?

*   **Option 1: Use a Historical Status Column:** Is there a data source that provides the official client status (\"Active\" or \"Dormant\") for each client as of different dates in the past? (Similar to how we need historical AUM).
*   **Option 2: Define Status Based on Activity:** Should we *define* \"Dormant\" based on inactivity *prior* to the `SnapshotDate`? For example:
    *   \"A client is considered 'Dormant' for a snapshot if they have had NO trades AND NO logins AND NO funding activity (deposits/payouts) in the X months/days preceding the `SnapshotDate`.\" (We would need to define 'X').
    *   If they had *any* activity in the lookback period, they are \"Active\".
*   **Option 3: Revisit Official Dormancy Data:** Should we use the `Parsed Dormancy Date` from the `BIUSER.LD_VWACCOUNTADDRESSDETAI` table we initially excluded? A client could be considered \"Dormant\" if their `SnapshotDate` is after their `Parsed Dormancy Date`. (This depends on the reliability of that data).

**Can we proceed?**

**Not yet.** We cannot fully implement the historical classification logic until we:

1.  **Clarify Historical Status Definition:** Decide *how* to determine if a client is \"Active\" or \"Dormant\" for each historical snapshot (using Option 1, 2, or 3 above, or another method). If Option 2, we need the exact inactivity rule (e.g., lookback period).
2.  **Receive Historical AUM Data:** This is still required.

**In summary:** The plan to integrate the classification is still viable, but the updated `Status Score` logic means we **must** incorporate a way to determine historical Active/Dormant status. Please clarify how we should define this historical status. Once we have that definition AND the historical AUM data, we can proceed."""),

This definition was chosen specifically to:

    *   **Modeling (`Churn_Modeling.ipynb`):**
        *   *Pro:* Reduces the number of models to build and evaluate initially (only 2 targets instead of 4). Simplifies the iterative process.
        *   *Con:* Prevents comparison of model performance across different time horizons. We lose insight into whether the model predicts short-term vs. long-term churn better, or if feature importance changes significantly.

    *   State that we can always choose *not* to train models for the 90/180 day labels later, but it's easier to exclude them during modeling than to regenerate the ABT if we later decide we need them.

They don't add significant overhead, and the data will be available if we decide to explore shorter windows later. We simply won't use them as targets initially.

1.  **Understand the User's New Proposal:**
    *   User has AUM data (good!).
    *   User suggests classifying clients *after* prediction.
    *   User implies \"client status\" (Active/Dormant) will be available *after* prediction, which will then feed into the classification.

2.  **Identify the Core Goal of the Classification:**
    *   The classification (New, Classic, Silver, Gold, Platinum) is based on a `Total Score`.
    *   This `Total Score` is derived from four component scores: Trading Days, AUM, Brokerage, and Recency.
    *   One of these component scores, `Trading Days Score`, *now depends on `Status Score (S)`*.
    *   `Status Score (S)` depends on whether the client is \"Active\" or \"Dormant\".

3.  **Analyze the \"Classify After Prediction\" Idea:**

    *   **What does \"after prediction\" mean in terms of data flow?**
        *   Prediction produces a churn probability or a churn label (0/1) for each snapshot in the test set.
        *   How does this prediction help determine if a client was \"Active\" or \"Dormant\" *historically* at the time of the snapshot (which is when the `Status Score` and thus the classification *features* need to be calculated)?

    *   **Potential Misunderstanding/Ambiguity:**
        *   Is the user thinking of classifying clients *based on their predicted churn status*? This is different from the Excel logic. The Excel logic is based on historical activity and AUM.
        *   Is the user thinking that the churn prediction process *itself* will yield a definitive \"Active\" or \"Dormant\" status that can be used as an input for the `Status Score`? The churn prediction gives a *future* likelihood of inactivity based on *past* features. It doesn't directly give a *past* \"Active/Dormant\" status.

4.  **Recall the Original Purpose of Adding Historical Classification:**
    *   The goal was to create `Historical_Tag` and `Historical_Total_Score` as **features for the churn prediction model**.
    *   Features need to be available *before* model training, calculated based on information available *up to the SnapshotDate*.

5.  **Identify the Conflict/Circular Dependency:**
    *   To create the classification features (`Historical_Tag`), we need `Status Score (S)`.
    *   To get `Status Score (S)`, we need historical \"Active/Dormant\" status.
    *   The user's proposal is to get \"Active/Dormant\" status *from* the churn prediction.
    *   But the churn prediction *uses* the classification features.
    *   This is a circular dependency: Features depend on status, status depends on prediction, prediction depends on features.

6.  **Consider Alternative Interpretations of User's Intent:**
    *   **Scenario A: Use classification for post-prediction analysis ONLY.**
        *   Train the churn model *without* the historical classification features.
        *   *After* getting churn predictions, *then* classify clients (perhaps using the latest AUM and activity for the *current* date, not historically).
        *   Then analyze churn rates within these *current* classifications.
        *   This is a valid analytical approach, but it means the classification is *not* a feature in the predictive model. This deviates from the \"incorporate classification into ABT\" plan.

    *   **Scenario B: User believes churn prediction directly outputs historical Active/Dormant status.**
        *   This is likely a misunderstanding of what the churn model outputs. The churn model predicts *future* inactivity. It doesn't directly tell us if a client was \"Active\" based on some business rule *in the past*.

7.  **Address the `Status Score (S)` issue directly for feature generation:**
    *   We *must* have a way to determine \"Active/Dormant\" status using information available *at or before the SnapshotDate* if we want to use the Excel classification logic as a feature.

8.  **Formulate a Recommendation:**
    *   **Acknowledge AUM data availability (positive).**
    *   **Clarify the timing:** Explain that features for the model need to be calculated *before* prediction.
    *   **Point out the circularity:** If \"Active/Dormant\" status for the `Status Score` comes from the churn prediction, we can't use the classification as a feature for that same prediction.
    *   **Re-state the need for a *historical* Active/Dormant definition:** We need a rule to determine this based on data *up to* the `SnapshotDate`.
    *   **Suggest options for historical Active/Dormant definition (reiterate from before):**
        *   Rule-based (e.g., no activity in X prior months).
        *   Official historical status data (if it exists).
        *   Using the official Dormancy Date.
    *   **Distinguish between using classification as a *feature* vs. for *post-hoc analysis*:**
        *   If it's for features, we need to solve the historical Active/Dormant status issue now.
        *   If it's only for analysis after prediction, we can train the model without these features, then classify clients based on their *current* state (or predicted churn state) and analyze churn rates within those segments. This is a different use case.

9.  **Refine Wording for Clarity and Politeness.** Ensure the explanation is easy to understand and doesn't sound accusatory.

This thought process leads directly to the kind of detailed explanation provided previously, addressing the user's new proposal while guiding back to the requirements for using the classification as a predictive feature."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""This is an interesting suggestion, but we need to be very careful about the timing and what we're trying to achieve. Let's clarify:

**Two Main Goals We've Discussed for the Classification:**

1.  **As Features for the Churn Prediction Model:**
    *   The idea was to calculate `Historical_Total_Score` and `Historical_Tag` (e.g., \"Gold\", \"Silver\") for each client snapshot in our ABT (2021-2023).
    *   These historically calculated tags/scores would then be used as **input features** to train the churn prediction model.
    *   To do this, all inputs for the classification (including the `Status Score (S)`) must be known or derivable *at the time of the historical snapshot*.

2.  **For Post-Prediction Analysis/Segmentation:**
    *   After we have a trained churn model and have made predictions (e.g., probability of churn), we could *then* classify clients (perhaps based on their most recent data, or their predicted churn status) and analyze how churn rates differ across these segments.

**The Challenge with \"Classify After Prediction\" for Goal #1 (Using as Features):**

If we want to use `Historical_Tag` as a feature in the model, we need to calculate it *before* we train the model. The current issue is:

*   `Historical_Tag` depends on `Historical_Total_Score`.
*   `Historical_Total_Score` depends on `Trading_Days_Score`.
*   `Trading_Days_Score` depends on `Status_Score (S)`.
*   `Status_Score (S)` (as per your latest update) depends on whether the client was \"Active\" or \"Dormant\" *at that historical snapshot moment*.

If \"client status\" (Active/Dormant) is only determined *after* prediction (i.e., from the model's output), then we create a **circular dependency**:
`Historical_Tag (Feature) -> depends on Status -> which depends on Prediction -> which uses Historical_Tag (Feature)`

This means we cannot use the classification (which depends on this future-derived status) as an input feature for the same prediction model.

**Let's Clarify Your Intent:**

When you say \"classify the clients after prediction, as we will get client status then,\" what \"client status\" are you referring to?

*   **A. Are you thinking the churn model's output (Churned=1, Not_Churned=0) IS the \"Active/Dormant\" status we need for the `Status Score`?**
    *   If so, this is problematic for using classification as an *input feature*, as explained by the circular dependency. The model's output is what we are *trying to predict*; it can't also be an input to a feature for itself.
*   **B. Or, are you now thinking of abandoning the idea of using the historical Excel-based classification as a *feature* in the model, and instead, only using it for analysis *after* the model has made its predictions?**
    *   If this is the case, then yes, we can proceed to build the churn model *without* these historical classification features. Then, after predictions are made, we can segment clients (perhaps based on their predicted churn status, or their *current* activity levels unrelated to the historical Excel logic) and analyze. This is a different approach.

**To Proceed with the Original Plan (Classification as a Feature):**

If we still want to use the historical Excel-based classification as an **input feature** for the churn model:

1.  **We still need a way to define \"Active\" vs. \"Dormant\" historically *without relying on the output of the churn model itself*.**
    Possible ways to define historical Active/Dormant status (for the `Status Score` calculation):
    *   **Rule-based on past activity:** e.g., \"A client is 'Dormant' for a snapshot if they had NO trades, logins, or funding in the 6 months *prior* to the `SnapshotDate`.\" Otherwise, 'Active'.
    *   **Using `FIRSTTRADEDATE` (N4) alone isn't enough for \"Active/Dormant\".** The formula you gave `IF(N4=0,0,75)` was specifically for *Dormant* clients. We first need to know *if* they are Dormant.
    *   Could we simplify the `Status Score` for now if defining historical \"Active/Dormant\" is too complex? For example, could we temporarily revert to a fixed `Status Score` of 100 for all, just to get the rest of the classification logic in place, and then refine it later? This would be less accurate to the Excel logic but might allow progress.

**My Recommendation:**

Let's clarify which path you prefer:

1.  **Path 1: Classification as an Input Feature (Preferred for richer model):**
    *   We need to define a rule for historical \"Active/Dormant\" status based on data available *before* or *at* the `SnapshotDate` (e.g., recent activity lookback).
    *   You provide the AUM data.
    *   We implement the full historical classification (including the refined `Status Score`) in the ABT.
    *   We train the churn model using `Historical_Tag` as a feature.

2.  **Path 2: Classification for Post-Prediction Analysis Only:**
    *   We build the churn model *without* the historical Excel-based classification features. (We still need AUM if other features depend on it, but not for this specific classification logic).
    *   After getting predictions, we can then do a separate analysis, perhaps classifying clients based on their *current* state or predicted outcome.

**Revised Plan:**

1.  **No Historical Excel-Based Classification as Model Input Features:**
    *   We will **NOT** attempt to calculate `Historical_Total_Score` or `Historical_Tag` (from the Excel logic) as input features for the churn prediction model in the `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` script.
    *   This means we no longer need to resolve the \"Active/Dormant\" status for the `Status Score (S)` for the purpose of ABT feature generation, nor do we need the fixed TARGET values specifically for *this Excel classification*.
    *   **AUM Data:** You mentioned you have AUM data. We should still consider if AUM itself (or features derived from it, like AUM change, AUM ratios, etc.) would be valuable *independent* features for the churn model, separate from the Excel classification logic. If so, we'd still want to load and process it.

2.  **ABT Generation Focus:**
    *   The `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` script will focus on creating features related to:
        *   Tenure
        *   Recency (trade, funding, login)
        *   Frequency (trade days, login days over various lookbacks)
        *   Monetary (brokerage sums)
        *   Funding flows
        *   Ratios and Deltas of these metrics
        *   *(Potentially AUM-based features if deemed useful and AUM data is provided)*
    *   And, of course, calculating the churn target variables: `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` and `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`.

3.  **Churn Model Training (`Churn_Modeling.ipynb`):**
    *   We will train the churn prediction models (Logistic Regression, RandomForest, GBT) using the features generated in step 2.
    *   The model will output churn probabilities and predictions (Churned=1, Not_Churned=0) for the 270-day and 365-day windows.

4.  **Post-Prediction Classification & Integration:**
    *   **After** the churn model has made its predictions, we will have a dataset that includes `CLIENTCODE`, `SnapshotDate`, predicted churn status, and the original features.
    *   At this stage, you want to apply the Excel-based classification logic.
    *   **Key Step:** We will use the model's output (`Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays`) to determine the \"Active/Dormant\" status needed for the `Status Score (S)` calculation within the Excel classification logic.
        *   If `Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays = 1` (Predicted Churned), you might consider this client as \"Dormant\" for the purpose of the Excel classification's `Status Score`.
        *   If `Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays = 0` (Predicted Not Churned), you might consider this client as \"Active\" for the purpose of the Excel classification's `Status Score`.
    *   With this derived \"Active/Dormant\" status, and the AUM data (applied to the data at the `SnapshotDate` of the prediction), we can then calculate the `Total Score` and `Tag` (e.g., \"Gold\", \"Silver\") from the Excel logic.
    *   These newly calculated classification Tags will then be added to the prediction output table.

**Implications and Considerations:**

*   **Simpler ABT Generation:** This simplifies the `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` script as we are removing the complex historical Excel classification logic from it.
*   **AUM Data Still Potentially Useful:** While not needed for the Excel classification *within* the ABT, AUM data might still be a good predictor on its own. If you provide it, we can incorporate AUM-related features directly into the ABT.
*   **Nature of the Classification:** The classification Tag (e.g., \"Gold\") derived *after* prediction will be based on a *mix* of historical data (like trade counts, brokerage used for the score components) and the *model's prediction* (which influences the Status Score). This makes the Tag an outcome of both historical behavior and predicted future behavior. It's important to be clear about this when interpreting these post-prediction tags.
*   **Purpose of Post-Prediction Classification:** This is useful for segmenting the predicted churners/non-churners into business-relevant categories (like \"Predicted Churner who is Gold tier\") for targeted retention strategies or further analysis.

**Actionable Plan Now:**

1.  **AUM Data:** Do you want to provide the AUM data to be used as a potential direct feature in the churn model (independent of the Excel classification logic)?
    *   If yes: Provide the AUM data (Jan 2021 - Dec 2023, monthly). We'll add AUM-based features to the ABT.
    *   If no: We proceed without AUM-specific features.
2.  **Finalize ABT Generation:** We ensure `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` is robustly creating all other planned features and the two churn target variables (`Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`, `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`). The script should be fixed for the `Gross_Brokerage_Sum_30D` issue.
3.  **Proceed to Modeling:** Move to `Churn_Modeling.ipynb` to train and evaluate models.
4.  **Implement Post-Prediction Classification:** After modeling, we'll devise a script/process to take the prediction output, apply the Excel classification logic (using the model's churn prediction to determine Active/Dormant for the Status Score, and using AUM for the snapshot date), and add the resulting Tags to the output.

Before proceeding with generating the full ABT for the 270/365-day churn models, and before any classification (historical or post-prediction), you want to perform an analysis to **optimize or better understand the churn window itself.**

To do this, your first step is to calculate a **single, overall average time between two consecutive trades across all clients.**

Here's what I've understood about this request:

1.  **Goal:** Determine a typical inter-trade duration for your client base. This metric could provide insights into natural trading frequencies and help inform what constitutes a significant period of inactivity (and thus, a reasonable churn window).
2.  **Scope:** This calculation should be done across **all clients** and **all their trades** within the available historical data (likely from `trade_data.txt`).
3.  **Metric:** \"Average time between two trades.\"
4.  **Method (Conceptual):**
    *   For each client, identify all their trade dates.
    *   Sort these trade dates chronologically.
    *   Calculate the difference (in days) between each consecutive pair of trade dates for that client.
    *   Collect all these inter-trade differences from all clients.
    *   Calculate the average of all these collected differences.
5.  **Purpose in Relation to Churn Window:** By understanding this average, you might:
    *   See if common churn windows (like 90, 180, 270, 365 days) are significantly longer than this average inter-trade time.
    *   Potentially identify data-driven thresholds for inactivity. For example, if the average inter-trade time is 30 days, then a client not trading for 90 days (3x the average) might be a stronger signal than if the average was 60 days.
    *   This is an exploratory step to refine the churn definition or to provide context to the existing churn windows rather than directly setting a new one solely based on this average.

**Next Steps (How I can help):**

*   We will need to use the `trade_data.txt` file.
*   We can write a PySpark script (or a new section in an existing notebook) to perform this calculation.
*   The script will involve:
    *   Loading the trade data.
    *   Parsing `CLIENTCODE` and `TRADEDATE`.
    *   Using window functions partitioned by `CLIENTCODE` and ordered by `TRADEDATE` to find the `LAG` (previous) trade date.
    *   Calculating the `DATEDIFF` between the current trade date and the previous trade date.
    *   Filtering out null differences (which occur for the first trade of each client).
    *   Calculating the overall average of these valid differences.

I'm ready to proceed with outlining or helping you write the PySpark code for this calculation when you are. This is a good foundational analysis step."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Here's a thinking process to evaluate the \"average time between trades\" step:

1.  **Understand the User's Goal:** The user wants to \"optimize the window to churn\" and, as a first step, calculate \"a single average time between two trades for all clients.\"

2.  **Evaluate the Metric (\"Average Time Between Trades\"):**
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Provides a baseline understanding of typical trading frequency.
        *   Simple to understand and communicate.
        *   Can be a starting point for discussion about what constitutes \"inactivity.\"
        *   Data-driven.
    *   **Cons/Limitations:**
        *   **Skewness:** Averages can be heavily skewed by outliers (e.g., clients who trade very frequently or very infrequently). A few clients with extremely long gaps could inflate the average, or many clients with very short gaps could deflate it.
        *   **Heterogeneity:** Client behavior is likely diverse. Some clients are day traders, others are long-term investors. A single average might mask these important segments. \"Active\" for one segment might be \"dormant\" for another.
        *   **Doesn't directly define churn:** While informative, this average doesn't inherently tell you the *optimal* churn window. Churn is about *cessation* of activity after a period of engagement, not just the typical gap.
        *   **Ignores other activities:** This focuses solely on trades, ignoring logins or funding activities, which are part of our current refined churn definition.

3.  **Relate to Churn Window Optimization:**
    *   How does this average help optimize the churn window?
        *   It can provide a \"sanity check.\" If the average inter-trade time is, say, 15 days, then a 90-day window seems reasonable for capturing significant inactivity. If the average was 150 days, then a 90-day window might be too short.
        *   It can inform discussions about different *thresholds* of inactivity. For example, 2x average inter-trade time, 3x, etc.
        *   However, it's unlikely to be the *sole determinant* of the optimal churn window. Other factors (business impact, sensitivity of prediction, login activity) are also important.

4.  **Consider Alternatives/Complements:**
    *   **Median inter-trade time:** Less sensitive to outliers.
    *   **Distribution of inter-trade times (histogram/percentiles):** Provides a much richer picture than a single average. This would show if there are distinct clusters of trading frequencies. This is a *strong* recommendation to add.
    *   **Segment-specific averages/distributions:** E.g., for high-value vs. low-value clients, or new vs. tenured clients.
    *   **Analysis of \"last activity to churn\" duration:** For clients who *have* churned (by some definition), what was the typical time from their last activity (trade/login) to when they met the churn criteria? This is more directly related to churn behavior.

5.  **Evaluate the \"New Notebook\" Approach:**
    *   **Pros:** Keeps exploratory analysis separate from the main ABT generation and modeling pipelines. Good for focused investigation.
    *   **Cons:** None significant, as long as insights are brought back to inform the main project.

6.  **Formulate a Recommendation:**
    *   **Acknowledge the value:** Yes, it's a reasonable *first step* and can provide *some* insight.
    *   **Highlight limitations:** Point out the skewness and heterogeneity issues.
    *   **Suggest improvements/next steps:** Strongly recommend looking at the distribution (histogram, percentiles, median) instead of just the mean. Suggest considering other activity types (logins) if the goal is to optimize a churn window that includes them.
    *   **Connect back to the churn definition:** Remind the user that the current churn definition considers both trades and logins. This analysis is trade-focused.
    *   **Agree with the new notebook:** It's a good place for this kind of exploration.

7.  **Structure the Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear \"Yes, this is a good exploratory step.\"
    *   Explain *why* it's good (provides baseline, data-driven).
    *   Introduce *important considerations/limitations* (skewness, heterogeneity, trade-only focus).
    *   Suggest *valuable additions* (median, distribution, percentiles).
    *   Confirm that a new notebook is appropriate.
    *   Offer to help with the implementation.

**(Self-correction during the process):** Initially, I might just say \"yes, it's good.\" But then, thinking about the *goal* (optimizing churn window) and the *limitations* of a single average, I realize it's crucial to manage expectations and suggest more robust analytical approaches. The aim is to be helpful and guide towards more insightful analysis. The user asked \"Is this step good?\" – a good answer explains *why* and *what to be aware of*."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Yes, this is a **good exploratory step**, and working in a **new notebook** for this kind of focused analysis is an excellent idea.

**Why this step is good:**

1.  **Data-Driven Insight:** It provides a foundational, data-driven metric about your clients' typical trading behavior.
2.  **Baseline Understanding:** It helps establish a baseline for what \"normal\" trading frequency looks like across your entire client base.
3.  **Context for Churn Windows:** The result can provide context when evaluating predefined churn windows (like 270 or 365 days). For instance, if the average inter-trade time is 20 days, then a 270-day window represents a very long period of inactivity relative to the average. If the average inter-trade time was 150 days, a 270-day window might seem less extreme.
4.  **Simplicity:** It's a relatively straightforward metric to calculate and understand as a starting point.

**Working in a new notebook is beneficial because:**

1.  **Focus:** It allows you to concentrate solely on this specific analysis without clutter from the ABT generation or modeling code.
2.  **Exploration:** It's a good environment for iterative exploration. You might calculate this average, then decide to look at medians, distributions, or segment by client type, all within this dedicated space.
3.  **Clarity:** It keeps your main project notebooks (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`, `Churn_Modeling.ipynb`) cleaner and focused on their primary tasks.

**Important Considerations as we proceed with this analysis (and beyond just the average):**

*   **Averages can be skewed:** A simple average can be heavily influenced by outliers (e.g., very infrequent traders or hyper-active traders). Looking at the **median** inter-trade time as well would be valuable.
*   **Distribution is key:** Beyond a single average or median, understanding the **distribution** of inter-trade times (e.g., via a histogram or calculating percentiles like 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th) will give a much richer picture. This will show if there are distinct groups of clients with different trading cadences.
*   **Segment-Specific Averages:** Later, you might want to calculate this average for different client segments if you suspect their behavior varies significantly.
*   **This is trade-specific:** Remember our refined churn definition also includes logins. This analysis will give insight into *trading* inactivity.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the average number of days between a client's consecutive trades, aggregated across all clients.

2.  **Identify Necessary Data:** We need `CLIENTCODE` and `TRADEDATE` from the `trade_data.txt` file.

3.  **Core Logic - Inter-Trade Time for a Single Client:**
    *   For a given client, list all their trade dates.
    *   Sort these dates.
    *   For each trade (except the first), find the date of the *previous* trade.
    *   Calculate the difference in days between the current trade and the previous trade.

4.  **Translating to PySpark:**
    *   **Loading Data:** The first step is always loading the data. We need to specify the path, delimiter, schema (or infer it, but explicit is better for dates), and header.
        *   `spark.read.csv(...)` or `spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(...).load(...)`
        *   Path: `trade_data_path` (assuming it's defined).
        *   Delimiter: `~` (as used before).
        *   Header: `True`.
        *   Schema: We need `CLIENTCODE` as String and `TRADEDATE` as Date (or String initially, then convert).
    *   **Date Conversion:** Ensure `TRADEDATE` is in a proper DateType format for date calculations. `to_date` function will be needed if it's read as a string. The format `dd-MM-yy` needs to be specified.
    *   **Finding Previous Trade Date (Window Function):** The `lag()` window function is perfect for this.
        *   `Window.partitionBy(\"CLIENTCODE\").orderBy(\"TRADEDATE\")` defines the scope for `lag()`.
        *   `lag(\"TRADEDATE\", 1).over(window_spec)` will get the trade date from the previous row within each client's ordered trades.
    *   **Calculating Date Difference:** `datediff(end_date, start_date)` calculates the difference in days. Here, `end_date` is the current `TRADEDATE`, and `start_date` is the `Previous_Trade_Date`.
    *   **Handling First Trades:** The `lag()` function will produce `null` for the first trade of each client (as there's no previous trade). These nulls need to be filtered out before calculating the average, otherwise, they might cause errors or skew results if not handled correctly by `avg()`. A `where(col(\"Days_Between_Trades\").isNotNull())` or `dropna()` is suitable.
    *   **Aggregating for Overall Average:** After calculating `Days_Between_Trades` for all valid pairs, use `agg(avg(\"Days_Between_Trades\"))` to get the single overall average.

5.  **Code Structure and Best Practices:**
    *   **Imports:** Include necessary PySpark functions: `col`, `to_date`, `lag`, `datediff`, `avg`, `Window`.
    *   **SparkSession:** Ensure a SparkSession is initialized.
    *   **Variable Names:** Use clear and descriptive variable names (e.g., `trade_df`, `trades_with_prev_date`, `inter_trade_times_df`).
    *   **Comments:** Add comments to explain non-obvious steps.
    *   **Output:** Display the result using `.show()` or `.collect()`.

6.  **Pre-computation/Pre-analysis (Self-Correction/Refinement):**
    *   **Data Cleaning:** Are there duplicate trades for the same client on the same day? The `lag` approach assumes unique trade dates or distinct rows for each trade event. If there are multiple entries for the same client on the same day, `datediff` would be 0. For inter-trade time, we likely only care about distinct days with trades. A `distinct()` on `CLIENTCODE` and `TRADEDATE` *before* the lag operation might be useful to ensure we are calculating time between *distinct trading days*. This is an important consideration for accuracy. Let's add that.
    *   **Data Volume/Performance:** For very large datasets, consider if any optimizations are needed, but for now, the approach should be efficient enough.
    *   **What if a client has only one trade?** `lag()` will produce null, and `datediff` will be null. The `isNotNull()` filter handles this correctly by excluding them from the average.

7.  **Final Output Formatting:** The question asks for a \"single average\". The `avg()` aggregation will produce a DataFrame with one row and one column. `collect()[0][0]` or `first()[0]` can extract the scalar value.

By following these steps, we can construct the PySpark code systematically. The `distinct()` part for trade dates is a good refinement that comes from thinking about the nuances of the data."""),

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:** Standard SparkSession setup and imports.
2.  **Load Data:**
    *   Reads `trade_data.txt` assuming `~` delimiter and header.
    *   **Crucially**, it converts the `TRADEDATE` column from string `dd-MM-yy` to a Spark `DateType` using `to_date`. If your date format in the file is different (e.g., `MM-dd-yy` or `yyyy-MM-dd`), you **must** adjust the format string in `to_date`. I've used \"dd-MM-yy\" as per our prior discussions of the `LOGIN_YYYY-MM.txt` files (assuming TRADEDATE in trade\\_data.txt might be similar to the DD/MM/YYYY of login files).
    *   Filters out any rows where date conversion failed.
3.  **Distinct Trading Days:**
    *   `distinct_trade_days_df = trade_df.select(\"ClientCode\", \"TradeDate\").distinct()`: This step is important. If a client trades multiple times on the *same day*, we consider it as one \"trading day event\" for calculating the time *between* distinct trading days.
4.  **Calculate Previous Trade Date:**
    *   `Window.partitionBy(\"ClientCode\").orderBy(\"TradeDate\")`: Defines a window for each client, with their trades ordered by date.
    *   `lag(\"TradeDate\", 1).over(window_spec)`: For each trade, this gets the `TradeDate` of the *previous* trade within that client's window. The first trade for each client will have `null` for `Previous_TradeDate`.
5.  **Calculate Days Between Trades:**
    *   `datediff(col(\"TradeDate\"), col(\"Previous_TradeDate\"))`: Calculates the difference in days between the current trade and the previous one.
6.  **Filter and Average:**
    *   `filter(col(\"Days_Between_Trades\").isNotNull())`: Removes the records corresponding to the first trade of each client, as they don't have a preceding trade to calculate the difference from.
    *   `agg(avg(\"Days_Between_Trades\").alias(\"Average_Days_Between_Trades\"))`: Calculates the average of all the valid `Days_Between_Trades` values.
    *   The code also counts how many inter-trade periods are used for the average.
7.  **Optional Quantiles:**
    *   The `approxQuantile` function is used to get an idea of the distribution, including the median (50th percentile). This is often more robust to outliers than a simple average.

**Before Running:**

*   **File Path:** Ensure `trade_data_path` points to the correct location of your `trade_data.txt`.
*   **Date Format:** **Double-check the exact date format in your `TRADEDATE` column** in `trade_data.txt` and update the `to_date(col(\"TRADEDATE\"), \"dd-MM-yy\")` function accordingly if it's not `dd-MM-yy`.
*   **Spark Environment:** Make sure your Spark environment is set up (e.g., in Colab, this usually involves installing PySpark and potentially setting up `findspark`).

**Key Changes:**

1.  **Google Drive Mount (Cell Block 0):**
    *   A `try-except` block is added at the beginning to attempt mounting Google Drive using `from google.colab import drive; drive.mount('/content/drive')`.
    *   It sets a `google_drive_base_path` variable. If the mount is successful (running in Colab), it points to `/content/drive/MyDrive/`. You might need to adjust `MyDrive` if your Google Drive's main folder has a different name or casing.
    *   If `google.colab` module is not found (e.g., running locally), it prints a message and sets `google_drive_base_path` to an empty string, assuming local paths will be used.
2.  **File Path Update:**
    *   `input_base_dir_drive = os.path.join(google_drive_base_path, 'Tables/')`
    *   `trade_data_path` now correctly constructs the full path to your `trade_data.txt` file within the `Tables` folder in your Google Drive.

When you run this in Colab, the first time it hits the `drive.mount` line, it will prompt you with a URL to authorize Colab to access your Google Drive. You'll need to click the link, sign in, copy the authorization code, and paste it back into the Colab input field. After that, your Drive will be mounted at `/content/drive/`."""),

**Corrections based on your input:**

2.  **Date Format:**
    *   `04/08/2020` means `DD/MM/YYYY`. My code used `dd-MM-yy` for `to_date`. This **must be corrected** to `dd/MM/yyyy`.

**Key Changes in this Version:**

1.  **Delimiter:**
    *   ` .option(\"delimiter\", \",\") `
    *   I've changed the delimiter to a comma (`,`) because your sample row `SABD9627,04/08/2020,596.815017700195` strongly suggests it's comma-separated.
    *   **Please VERIFY if your actual `trade_data.txt` file uses commas or tildes (`~`) as delimiters.** If it's still tildes, change this back to `.option(\"delimiter\", \"~\")`.
2.  **Column Names in `select`:**
    *   `col(\"CLIENTCODE\").alias(\"ClientCode\")`: Kept the alias for internal consistency, but it reads from the exact `CLIENTCODE` column.
    *   `to_date(col(\"TRADE_DATE\"), \"dd/MM/yyyy\").alias(\"TradeDate\")`:
        *   Reads from the exact `TRADE_DATE` column.
        *   Uses the correct date format string `\"dd/MM/yyyy\"` to parse dates like `04/08/2020`.

With these adjustments, the code should now correctly align with the structure of your `trade_data.txt` file. The most important thing for you to **double-check is the delimiter option**."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""This is excellent output! These results give us some very valuable insights into the trading frequency of your clients.

Let's break down what these numbers mean:

1.  **Single Overall Average Time Between Trades: 8.14 days**
    *   On average, there are about 8.14 days between any two consecutive trading days for a client.
    *   **Caution:** As we discussed, averages can be skewed by outliers (clients who trade very, very infrequently, pulling the average up). The quantiles will help us see this.

2.  **Based on 16,988,962 inter-trade periods.**
    *   This is a very large number of data points, which means our statistics are based on a robust sample of trading behavior.

3.  **Approximate Quantiles for Days Between Trades:**
    *   **25th Percentile (Q1): 1.00 days**
        *   25% of the time, the gap between two trades is 1 day (meaning clients often trade on consecutive days).
    *   **50th Percentile (Median): 2.00 days**
        *   **This is a key metric!** Half of the inter-trade periods are 2 days or less, and half are 2 days or more. This suggests that a very significant portion of trading activity happens quite frequently.
        *   The median (2 days) is much lower than the average (8.14 days). This strongly indicates that the distribution of inter-trade times is **right-skewed**, meaning there's a long tail of much larger inter-trade gaps that are pulling the average up.
    *   **75th Percentile (Q3): 4.00 days**
        *   75% of the inter-trade periods are 4 days or less. This means 3 out of 4 times, clients trade again within 4 days of their last trade.
    *   **90th Percentile: 11.00 days**
        *   90% of the time, clients trade again within 11 days. Conversely, only 10% of inter-trade gaps are longer than 11 days.
    *   **95th Percentile: 23.00 days**
        *   95% of the time, clients trade again within 23 days. Only 5% of inter-trade gaps are longer than this.

**Key Takeaways & Implications for Churn Window Optimization:**

*   **High Trading Frequency for Most:** A large portion of your clients trade very frequently (median of 2 days, 75% within 4 days).
*   **Skewed Distribution Confirmed:** The average (8.14 days) being significantly higher than the median (2 days) confirms that while most inter-trade periods are short, there are enough longer periods to inflate the average.
*   **Context for Churn Windows (270 & 365 days):**
    *   Your proposed churn windows of 270 days and 365 days are *vastly* longer than the typical trading frequencies observed.
    *   For example, 95% of inter-trade gaps are less than 23 days. A client not trading for 270 days is experiencing an inactivity period that is more than 10 times longer than what 95% of typical inter-trade gaps represent.
    *   This doesn't mean 270/365 days are \"wrong,\" but it does mean that by the time a client hits that level of trading inactivity, they are exhibiting behavior far outside the norm for the vast majority of their active trading periods.
*   **Defining \"Significant Inactivity\":**
    *   Based on these numbers, even a much shorter period of trading inactivity (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, 90 days) would already capture clients who are well outside the 90th or 95th percentile of typical inter-trade gaps.
    *   For instance, if a client hasn't traded in 30 days, that's longer than ~95% of typical inter-trade gaps. This could already be a strong signal of disengagement from *trading*.

**Next Steps & Further Thoughts:**

1.  **Consider Login Activity:** Remember, our churn definition also incorporates login activity. It would be beneficial to do a similar analysis for \"average time between logins\" if that data is readily analyzable. The interplay between trading and login inactivity is key.
2.  **Distribution Visualization:** If possible, creating a histogram of the `Days_Between_Trades` (perhaps capping the x-axis at a reasonable number like 60 or 90 days to see the bulk of the distribution) would be very insightful.
3.  **What is \"Churn\" from a Business Perspective?**
    *   While the data shows typical trading is frequent, Religare's business definition of churn might be set at 270/365 days for specific reasons (e.g., regulatory, account maintenance policies, or a definition of when a client is truly considered \"lost\" for reactivation efforts).
    *   The current analysis helps understand how *early* the signals of disengagement (from trading) appear relative to those longer official churn windows.
4.  **Refining Churn Windows vs. Early Warning Signals:**
    *   You might stick with 270/365 days as the *ultimate* churn definition for your primary model.
    *   However, this analysis suggests you could potentially build models to predict shorter periods of inactivity (e.g., predicting clients who will have no trades for >30 days, or >60 days) as an *early warning system*. These clients might not be \"officially churned\" yet by the 270-day rule, but they are showing strong signs of disengagement.

This analysis provides a strong data-backed understanding of trading cadence. It clearly indicates that if a client who typically trades frequently stops trading for even a month or two, it's a significant deviation from their (and the population's) norm.

Creating separate churn target columns for different prediction windows (60, 90, 270, and 365 days) and then building models to predict churn for each of these windows independently is a robust and insightful strategy.

**Here's why this is a good plan:**

1.  **Captures Different Stages of Disengagement:**
    *   **60-day / 90-day windows:** These shorter windows can help identify clients who are showing *early signs* of significant disengagement from trading/logging in. These models could serve as an \"early warning system.\" The insights from the inter-trade time analysis (median 2 days, 95th percentile 23 days) suggest that 60 or 90 days of complete inactivity is already a very strong signal.
    *   **270-day / 365-day windows:** These longer windows align with a more definitive, longer-term definition of churn, where a client is likely considered truly inactive or lost from a business perspective.

2.  **Tailored Interventions:**
    *   Predicting churn at different stages allows for more tailored retention strategies.
    *   For clients predicted to churn in a 60-day window, interventions might be more immediate and focused on re-engagement.
    *   For clients predicted to churn in a 365-day window, the strategy might be different, perhaps focused on understanding long-term dissatisfaction or attempting a win-back.

3.  **Model Performance Comparison:**
    *   You can compare how well your models predict churn across these different timeframes. It might be easier or harder to predict churn for shorter vs. longer windows, and feature importance might vary.

4.  **Flexibility:**
    *   Having these different target variables in your ABT gives you flexibility. You can start by focusing on one or two, and then easily switch to modeling another window without regenerating the entire ABT.

**Implementation Plan Update:**

1.  **ABT Generation (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`):**
    *   When calculating the churn labels, we will now generate four target columns:
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`
    *   The logic for each will be the same:
        *   Condition A: (Trade\\_Days\\_Count\\_XXXD > 0 OR Login\\_Days\\_Count\\_XXXD > 0) in the XXX days *before* the snapshot.
        *   Condition B: (Trade\\_Days\\_In\\_Churn\\_Window\\_XXX <= 0 AND Login\\_Days\\_In\\_Churn\\_Window\\_XXX <= 0) in the XXX days *after* the snapshot.
        *   Where XXX will be 60, 90, 270, and 365 respectively.

2.  **Modeling (`Churn_Modeling.ipynb`):**
    *   You can then choose which of these target columns to use for a particular modeling run.
    *   For example, you might start by building a model for `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days` and another for `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` and compare their performance and insights.

This approach aligns well with the findings from your inter-trade time analysis, allowing you to explore both early disengagement and more definitive long-term churn. It's a more comprehensive way to tackle the churn prediction problem."""),

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to do more exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the *reasoning* behind the modeling choices, specifically the different churn windows (60, 90, 270, 365 days). This means looking for patterns and characteristics that differentiate clients who churn at these different horizons.

2.  **Recall Key Data Points & Definitions:**
    *   **Churn Definition:** Recent engagement (trade OR login) THEN subsequent inactivity (NO trade AND NO login).
    *   **Input Data:** Client details, trade data, login data, deposit data, payout data.
    *   **Generated Metrics (from ABT thinking):** Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Tenure.
    *   **Inter-Trade Time Analysis Results:** Median 2 days, Average 8.14 days, 95th percentile 23 days. This highlights that many clients are very active.

3.  **Brainstorm EDA Categories (Standard EDA approaches):**
    *   **Univariate Analysis:** Look at individual variable distributions.
    *   **Bivariate Analysis:** Compare variables against the target (or against each other).
    *   **Time-Based Analysis:** How do things change over time? Cohorts?
    *   **Segmentation:** Are there natural client groups?

4.  **Focus on \"Reasoning Behind Modeling Windows\":** How can EDA help justify or understand these different windows?
    *   **Early vs. Late Churn:** What distinguishes a client who stops engaging after 60 days versus one who stops after 270 days (assuming they were active before that window)?
    *   **Signal Strength:** How strong is the \"inactivity signal\" at each window?
    *   **Client Behavior Leading Up to Churn:** What did clients *do* (or *not do*) before they became inactive according to each window?

5.  **Generate Specific EDA Ideas, Connecting to Data and Goals:**

    *   **A. Analyze Activity Levels Before Inactivity (for different windows):**
        *   This directly addresses \"what did they do before?\"
        *   Idea: For clients who *eventually* meet the 60-day churn definition, what did their trade/login frequency look like in the 30/60/90 days *before* that 60-day period started? Compare this to clients who *didn't* churn in 60 days. Repeat for 90, 270, 365-day churners.
        *   Metrics: Trade frequency, login frequency, brokerage amount, deposit/payout activity.
        *   Benefit: See if early churners show a more rapid decline in activity *before* the churn window even starts.

    *   **B. Time to Churn Distribution (Conditional):**
        *   This relates to the inter-trade time analysis but is now specific to *actual churn events*.
        *   Idea: For clients who *were* active and then *became* inactive (no trades/logins), how long did it take for them to become inactive? Plot a distribution of \"days since last activity until first N-day inactivity period begins.\"
        *   Benefit: Understand how quickly clients typically transition from active to inactive. Does this distribution have peaks that align with our chosen windows?

    *   **C. Behavior of Clients Just Before Each Churn Window Threshold:**
        *   Idea: Look at clients who are *just about* to hit the 60-day inactivity mark. What was their behavior in the preceding 30 days? Compare to those who were active in that 30-day window and *remained* active.
        *   Benefit: Identify more immediate precursors to hitting a specific inactivity threshold.

    *   **D. Trajectory Analysis (More Advanced):**
        *   Idea: Plot key metrics (e.g., monthly trade count, monthly login count) over time for cohorts of clients who churned at 60, 90, 270, 365 days versus those who remained active.
        *   Benefit: Visually see if different churner groups have distinct \"activity decay\" patterns.

    *   **E. Recency Analysis at Different \"Potential Churn\" Points:**
        *   Idea: What's the distribution of \"days since last trade\" and \"days since last login\" for the population *at any given time*? How does this compare to the chosen windows?
        *   Benefit: Understand what proportion of the \"active\" base is already sitting at, say, 45 days of inactivity.

    *   **F. Impact of Lookback Period in Churn Definition:**
        *   Our churn definition has \"Condition A: Recent Engagement.\"
        *   Idea: How many clients satisfy Condition A (e.g., active in last 60 days) but then *don't* satisfy Condition B (i.e., they continue being active)? How does this change if we make the Condition A lookback shorter (e.g., active in last 30 days)?
        *   Benefit: Understand the sensitivity of the \"recently active\" part of our churn definition.

    *   **G. Client Tenure and Churn Window:**
        *   Idea: Do newer clients churn faster (e.g., more likely to be 60-day churners) compared to long-tenured clients?
        *   Benefit: Segment churn behavior by client lifecycle stage.

    *   **H. Activity Intensity and Churn Window:**
        *   Idea: Do highly active clients (high trade/login frequency when active) tend to churn differently (e.g., more abrupt stop vs. gradual fade) compared to less active clients?
        *   Benefit: Understand if prior engagement level influences churn pattern.

6.  **Structure and Refine the List:**
    *   Group similar ideas.
    *   Use clear, actionable titles.
    *   Briefly explain the \"What\" and \"Why/Benefit\" for each.
    *   Suggest data sources or metrics needed.
    *   Keep it focused on informing the modeling choices.

7.  **Self-Correction/Additions:**
    *   Initially, I might have just listed \"look at distributions of features.\" But the prompt is about *reasoning behind modeling windows*, so the EDA needs to be framed in terms of comparing churner groups or understanding transitions.
    *   The inter-trade time was good; now we need to link general activity to *churn events* defined by the windows.
    *   Make sure to emphasize both trade and login data, as per the churn definition.

This structured thinking helps generate a comprehensive yet targeted list of EDA tasks."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Excellent! Doing more exploratory work to solidify the reasoning behind your modeling choices, especially the selection of churn windows, is a very smart approach. It will give you deeper insights and more confidence in your model's purpose and interpretation.

Based on your goal and the data we have (trades, logins, etc.), here are several exploratory analyses we can perform in a new notebook (or continue in `00_explore_inter_trade_time.ipynb` if it makes sense to group them):

**I. Analyzing the \"Path to Inactivity\" for Different Churn Windows:**

This will help us understand if the behavior leading up to a 60-day churn event looks different from that leading up to a 270-day churn event.

1.  **Activity Levels *Before* the Churn Window Starts (for eventual churners):**
    *   **What:** For clients who eventually meet the `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` definition, what did their activity (trade count, login count, brokerage, funding activity) look like in the 30, 60, or 90 days *immediately preceding* the start of their 60-day inactivity period?
    *   Compare this to clients who eventually meet `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days` (looking at their activity before their 90-day inactivity), and similarly for 270 and 365 days.
    *   Also, compare these \"eventual churners\" to a baseline of \"consistently active\" clients.
    *   **Why:** To see if there's a noticeable decline or change in behavior *before* a client hits a specific inactivity threshold. Do 60-day churners show a more abrupt drop, while 270-day churners show a gradual fade?
    *   **Data Needed:** Trades, Logins, (Brokerage, Deposits, Payouts for more detail). We'd need to identify \"churn events\" based on our definition and then look backward.

2.  **Distribution of \"Time Since Last Activity\" for Active Population:**
    *   **What:** At any given point in time (or averaged over time), for clients currently considered \"active\" (e.g., traded/logged in within the last X days), what is the distribution of their `Days_Since_Last_Trade` and `Days_Since_Last_Login`?
    *   **Why:** To understand what proportion of the \"active\" base is already sitting at, say, 15 days of inactivity, 30 days, 45 days, etc. This helps see how \"close\" a typical active client is to hitting our shorter churn window thresholds. It provides a baseline for \"normal\" short-term inactivity within an active base.
    *   **Data Needed:** Trades, Logins.

3.  **\"Survival Analysis\" Style: Time to N-Day Inactivity:**
    *   **What:** For clients who were active at a certain point, how long does it take for them to experience their first continuous 60-day period of no trades AND no logins? Repeat for 90, 270, 365 days.
    *   Plot distributions or Kaplan-Meier-like curves.
    *   **Why:** To understand the natural rate at which clients transition into these defined inactivity states. Are there \"hazard\" peaks around certain durations?
    *   **Data Needed:** Trades, Logins.

**II. Characterizing Clients Who Churn at Different Windows:**

1.  **Profile Comparison of Churner Groups:**
    *   **What:** Once we can (hypothetically, using historical data to simulate) identify clients who would be tagged as `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days=1`, `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days=1`, etc., compare their characteristics:
        *   Tenure (activation date)
        *   Historical activity levels (average trade frequency, login frequency when they *were* active)
        *   Historical monetary value (average brokerage)
        *   Funding behavior (deposit/payout patterns)
    *   **Why:** To see if, for example, 60-day churners are typically newer clients or less engaged clients overall, while 270-day churners might include longer-tenured clients whose behavior changed more slowly.
    *   **Data Needed:** Client Master, Trades, Logins, Deposits, Payouts. This requires a way to define cohorts of churners based on historical data.

**III. Sensitivity of Churn Definition Components:**

1.  **Impact of \"Recent Engagement\" Lookback (Condition A):**
    *   Our churn definition requires recent engagement (trade OR login) in the XXX days *before* the snapshot.
    *   **What:** How does the number of clients qualifying for \"Condition A\" change if we vary this lookback? E.g., for a 60-day churn window, what if Condition A required activity in the last 30 days vs. last 60 days vs. last 90 days?
    *   Then, of those satisfying Condition A, how many go on to satisfy Condition B (inactivity in the forward window)?
    *   **Why:** To understand if the definition of \"recently active\" is too broad or too narrow and how it impacts the pool of potential churners we're identifying.

2.  **Trade-only vs. Login-only vs. Combined Inactivity:**
    *   **What:**
        *   How many clients stop trading for 60 days but still log in?
        *   How many stop logging in for 60 days but still trade?
        *   How many stop both?
        *   Repeat for 90, 270, 365 days.
    *   **Why:** To understand the individual and combined impact of trade and login inactivity and to validate that our definition requiring *both* types of inactivity to cease is meaningful. It helps see if one behavior (e.g., logins) persists longer than the other for disengaging clients.

**Tools & Techniques:**

*   **PySpark:** For data manipulation and aggregation.
*   **Visualization:** Histograms, box plots, line charts (for trajectories), scatter plots. Libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (can use after bringing aggregated Spark data to Pandas).
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Averages, medians, percentiles, counts.

**Starting Point:**

Given your recent inter-trade time analysis, a good next step might be **I.1 (Activity Levels *Before* the Churn Window Starts)** or **I.3 (\"Survival Analysis\" Style: Time to N-Day Inactivity)**. These directly build on understanding activity durations.

Let's outline how we can approach these two analyses:

**Analysis 1: \"Survival Analysis\" Style: Time to N-Day Inactivity (I.3)**

*   **Goal:** For clients active at a certain point, understand how long it takes for them to experience their first continuous N-day period of *no trades AND no logins*. We'll do this for N = 60, 90, 270, and 365 days.
*   **Conceptual Steps:**
    1.  **Define an \"Observation Start Point\" for each client:** This could be their `ACTIVATIONDATE` or their first known activity date (first trade or first login). For simplicity and to capture the full lifecycle, let's consider starting from their `ACTIVATIONDATE`.
    2.  **Identify all activity dates:** For each client, create a combined, sorted list of all their distinct trade dates and login dates.
    3.  **Calculate inter-activity gaps:** For each client, calculate the duration between consecutive *any-activity* dates (trade or login).
    4.  **Find the first N-day inactivity spell:** For each client, iterate through their inter-activity gaps. The \"time to N-day inactivity\" is the cumulative time from their `ACTIVATIONDATE` until they experience their first gap that is >= N days.
        *   If a client never experiences an N-day gap within the observation period, they are \"censored\" for that N.
    5.  **Aggregate and Analyze:** Collect these \"times to N-day inactivity\" for all clients and for each N.
        *   Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, percentiles).
        *   Plot a distribution (histogram) or a Kaplan-Meier-like survival curve (percentage of clients still \"active\" or not yet having hit N-day inactivity over time).

*   **Data Needed & Preprocessing:**
    *   `client_details.txt`: `CLIENTCODE`, `ACTIVATIONDATE`
    *   `trade_data.txt`: `CLIENTCODE`, `TRADE_DATE`
    *   `LOGIN_*.txt`: `CLIENTCODE`, `LOGIN_DATE`
    *   Combine trade and login dates into a single \"activity_date\" column per client, remove duplicates, and sort.

**Analysis 2: Trade-only vs. Login-only vs. Combined Inactivity (III.2)**

*   **Goal:** Understand the prevalence of different types of inactivity (trade-only, login-only, or both) over N-day windows (60, 90, 270, 365).
*   **Conceptual Steps (for a given N-day window, e.g., 60 days):**
    1.  **Define Snapshots:** We'll need to create periodic snapshots (e.g., monthly) across our entire data range (2021-2023), similar to the ABT.
    2.  **For each snapshot and each client:**
        *   **Look Forward N Days:**
            *   Count trade days in the N days *after* the snapshot.
            *   Count login days in the N days *after* the snapshot.
        *   **Categorize Inactivity:**
            *   `Stopped_Trading_Only`: (Trade days in N-day window = 0) AND (Login days in N-day window > 0)
            *   `Stopped_Logging_In_Only`: (Trade days in N-day window > 0) AND (Login days in N-day window = 0)
            *   `Stopped_Both` (Our Churn Definition's Condition B): (Trade days in N-day window = 0) AND (Login days in N-day window = 0)
            *   `Remained_Active_Both`: (Trade days in N-day window > 0) AND (Login days in N-day window > 0)
    3.  **Aggregate and Analyze:**
        *   For each N (60, 90, 270, 365), calculate the proportion of client snapshots falling into each inactivity category.
        *   This can be an overall proportion or tracked over time (e.g., how did the proportion of \"Stopped_Both\" for 60 days change month over month?).

*   **Data Needed & Preprocessing:**
    *   `trade_data.txt`: `CLIENTCODE`, `TRADE_DATE`
    *   `LOGIN_*.txt`: `CLIENTCODE`, `LOGIN_DATE`
    *   A way to generate snapshot dates (e.g., end of each month from 2021-01-01 to a point where we have enough forward-looking data for the longest window, e.g., up to 2023-12-31 minus 365 days).

**Which one to tackle first?**

*   **Analysis 1 (Time to N-Day Inactivity)** seems like a more natural continuation of your inter-trade time analysis. It focuses on event durations from the client's perspective. It's less complex in terms of snapshot generation than Analysis 2.
*   **Analysis 2 (Trade vs. Login Inactivity)** requires setting up a snapshotting mechanism similar to the ABT. While very valuable, it might be more involved to code initially.

**Recommendation:** Let's start with **Analysis 1: \"Survival Analysis\" Style: Time to N-Day Inactivity (I.3)**.

---

**Notebook: `01_explore_time_to_inactivity.ipynb`**

**Goal:** For clients active at a certain point (their activation date), understand how long it takes for them to experience their first continuous N-day period of *no trades AND no logins*. We'll do this for N = 60, 90, 270, and 365 days.

**PySpark Steps:**

**Phase 1: Data Loading and Initial Preparation**

1.  **Initialize SparkSession and Mount Drive (if Colab):**
    *   Standard SparkSession setup.
    *   Mount Google Drive if running in Colab.
    *   Define paths to data files.

2.  **Load Client Master Data (`client_details.txt`):**
    *   Read `CLIENTCODE` and `ACTIVATIONDATE`.
    *   Parse `ACTIVATIONDATE` into a DateType.
    *   Filter out clients with no valid `ACTIVATIONDATE`.
    *   Select distinct `CLIENTCODE`, `ACTIVATIONDATE`.

3.  **Load Trade Data (`trade_data.txt`):**
    *   Read `CLIENTCODE` and `TRADE_DATE`.
    *   Parse `TRADE_DATE` (e.g., \"dd/MM/yyyy\") into a DateType.
    *   Select `CLIENTCODE`, `TRADE_DATE`. Rename `TRADE_DATE` to `ActivityDate`.
    *   Add a column `ActivityType` with value \"Trade\".

4.  **Load Login Data (`LOGIN_*.txt`):**
    *   Read `ClientCode` and `DD/MM/YYYY` (login date) from all `LOGIN_*.txt` files (using wildcard path).
    *   Parse login date into a DateType.
    *   Select `ClientCode` (alias to `CLIENTCODE` for consistency), login date (alias to `ActivityDate`).
    *   Add a column `ActivityType` with value \"Login\".

5.  **Combine All Activities:**
    *   Union the processed trade DataFrame and login DataFrame.
    *   `df_all_activities = trades_df.unionByName(logins_df)` (ensure column names match for union)

6.  **Join Activities with Client Master:**
    *   Inner join `df_all_activities` with the client master DataFrame (`client_master_df`) on `CLIENTCODE`.
    *   Filter out activities that occurred *before* the client's `ACTIVATIONDATE` (though generally, this shouldn't happen if data is clean, it's a good safeguard).
    *   Select `CLIENTCODE`, `ACTIVATIONDATE`, `ActivityDate`.

7.  **Get Distinct Activity Dates Per Client (Post-Activation):**
    *   Group by `CLIENTCODE`, `ACTIVATIONDATE`, `ActivityDate` and take `first()` or use `distinct()`.
    *   This DataFrame will now have `CLIENTCODE`, `ACTIVATIONDATE`, and each distinct `ActivityDate` for that client on or after their activation. Let's call it `client_distinct_activities_df`.

**Phase 2: Calculate Inter-Activity Gaps**

8.  **Include Activation Date as an \"Activity\":**
    *   To correctly calculate the gap from activation to the first real activity, we need to treat the `ACTIVATIONDATE` itself as a point of reference.
    *   Create a DataFrame for activation dates: `activation_points_df = client_master_df.select(col(\"CLIENTCODE\"), col(\"ACTIVATIONDATE\").alias(\"ActivityDate\"))`
    *   Union `activation_points_df` with `client_distinct_activities_df` (which contains actual trade/login dates).
    *   Take `distinct()` again to handle cases where first activity might be on activation day. Let's call this `client_all_event_points_df`.

9.  **Calculate Previous Activity Date:**
    *   Define a window: `Window.partitionBy(\"CLIENTCODE\").orderBy(\"ActivityDate\")`
    *   Use `lag(\"ActivityDate\", 1).over(window_spec)` to get `Previous_ActivityDate`. The first event point (which will be the activation date if no earlier activity) will have a null `Previous_ActivityDate`.

10. **Calculate Gap Durations:**
    *   `datediff(col(\"ActivityDate\"), col(\"Previous_ActivityDate\"))` to get `Gap_In_Days`.
    *   This gap represents the number of days of *inactivity* *preceding* the current `ActivityDate`.

**Phase 3: Find Time to First N-Day Inactivity Spell**

11. **Iterate for Each N (60, 90, 270, 365):**
    *   For a specific N (e.g., N=60):
        *   Filter the DataFrame from step 10 to find the first row per client where `Gap_In_Days >= N`.
            *   `Window.partitionBy(\"CLIENTCODE\").orderBy(\"ActivityDate\")`
            *   Add a `row_number()` over this window.
            *   Filter for `Gap_In_Days >= N` AND `row_number() == 1`.
        *   The `ActivityDate` in this filtered row is the date on which the N-day inactivity spell *concluded* (or, more precisely, the date of the activity that *broke* the spell, meaning the spell occurred just before it).
        *   `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity = datediff(col(\"ActivityDate_of_Spell_End\"), col(\"ACTIVATIONDATE\"))`. This represents the total days from activation until the N-day inactivity spell was *first observed as ending*.
            *   Alternatively and perhaps more intuitively: The `Previous_ActivityDate` marks the *start* of the N-day (or longer) inactivity spell. The `ActivityDate` marks the *end* of that spell. The \"time to N-day inactivity\" is the duration from `ACTIVATIONDATE` to the `Previous_ActivityDate` when the first such `Gap_In_Days >= N` occurs.
            *   Let's refine:
                *   Identify rows where `Gap_In_Days >= N`.
                *   For each client, find the *first* such row (minimum `ActivityDate` where this condition is met).
                *   The `Previous_ActivityDate` of this row is the `Start_of_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Spell`.
                *   `Time_To_Start_of_First_N_Day_Inactivity = datediff(col(\"Start_of_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Spell\"), col(\"ACTIVATIONDATE\"))`. This tells us how many days into their lifecycle they *began* their first significant inactivity.
        *   Store this result (e.g., `CLIENTCODE`, `Time_To_Start_of_First_60_Day_Inactivity`).

12. **Handle Censored Clients:**
    *   Clients who *never* experience an N-day inactivity spell within the observation period of our data are \"censored\".
    *   For each N, clients not present in the result of step 11 are censored for that N.
    *   To calculate their \"censoring time,\" find their `last_known_activity_date` from `client_all_event_points_df`.
    *   `Censoring_Time_N = datediff(col(\"last_known_activity_date\"), col(\"ACTIVATIONDATE\"))`.
    *   We also need an indicator column `Is_Censored_N` (True/False).

13. **Combine Results for Each N:**
    *   Join the calculated times for N=60, 90, 270, 365 back to the `client_master_df`. Use left joins so all clients are included.
    *   Fill nulls for `Time_To_Start_of_First_N_Day_Inactivity` with their `Censoring_Time_N` (if they were censored).
    *   You'll have columns like:
        *   `CLIENTCODE`
        *   `ACTIVATIONDATE`
        *   `Time_To_First_60D_Inactivity_Start` (or censoring time)
        *   `Is_Censored_60D`
        *   `Time_To_First_90D_Inactivity_Start` (or censoring time)
        *   `Is_Censored_90D`
        *   ... and so on for 270D and 365D.

**Phase 4: Analysis and Visualization**

14. **Descriptive Statistics:**
    *   For each N, calculate mean, median, percentiles for `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start` (considering only non-censored clients for these stats, or using methods that account for censoring if doing formal survival analysis).
    *   Report the percentage of clients censored for each N.

15. **Visualization (Kaplan-Meier Style - conceptual):**
    *   For each N:
        *   Sort the `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start` values.
        *   Iterate through unique time points.
        *   At each time point `t`, calculate the proportion of clients who have *not yet* started their first N-day inactivity spell (i.e., their `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start > t` or they are censored with `Censoring_Time > t`).
        *   Plot this proportion against `t`. This gives a \"survival curve\" showing the rate at which clients remain \"active\" (haven't hit N-day inactivity).
    *   Alternatively, plot histograms of the `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start` for non-censored clients.

        .option(\"header\", \"true\") \\
        .option(\"delimiter\", \"~\") \\

except Exception as e:
    print(f\"Error loading client_details.txt: {e}\")
    # spark.stop() # Stop Spark if critical error
    # exit()
```

    print(f\"Total login activities: {logins_df.count()}\")
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f\"Error loading login data: {e}\")
```
*Initial Thought:* The login files often have trimming issues with ClientCode. If `ClientCode_raw` contains spaces or other characters, we might need a `trim(col(\"ClientCode_raw\"))` or a UDF for more complex cleaning if that comes up. For now, assuming it's clean.

**Cell 5: Combine All Activities (Phase 1, Step 5)**

else:
    print(\"Skipping activity combination as one of the DFs is missing.\")
```

**Cell 6: Join Activities with Client Master & Filter Pre-Activation (Phase 1, Step 6 & 7)**

```python
# --- Join Activities with Client Master & Get Distinct Post-Activation Activities ---

This covers Phase 1. Before we proceed to Phase 2 (Calculating Inter-Activity Gaps), please run these cells.

**Key things to check during/after running these first cells:**

1.  **`ACTIVATIONDATE` format:** The `to_date` format string `dd-MMM-yy` (e.g., \"01-Jan-20\") for `client_details.txt` is an assumption. Please verify the actual format in your file and correct it if necessary. Common alternatives: \"dd-MM-yy\", \"MM/dd/yy\", \"yyyy-MM-dd\".
2.  **Successful Loads:** Ensure all three data sources load without errors and the counts seem reasonable.
3.  **Date Parsing:** The `show(5)` outputs should display correctly parsed dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (Spark's default display for DateType). If you see `null` in date columns, the parsing format is wrong.
4.  **Login ClientCode:** Check if `ClientCode` from login files looks clean (no extra spaces, etc.).

**Correction for `ACTIVATIONDATE` format:**

Your sample `ACTIVATIONDATE` is `01/07/2006`. This means the format is `dd/MM/yyyy`.

**Corrected Cell 2: Load Client Master Data**

```python
# --- Load Client Master Data ---
try:
    client_master_df_raw = spark.read.format(\"csv\") \\
        .option(\"header\", \"true\") \\
        .option(\"delimiter\", \",\") \\ # Corrected: Your sample shows comma-separated

**Key Changes in Corrected Cell 2:**

1.  **Delimiter:** Changed from `~` to `,` because your sample row `ABBA1001,01/07/2006,,,` clearly shows comma separation for `client_details.txt`.
2.  **Date Format for `ACTIVATIONDATE`:** Changed `to_date(col(\"ACTIVATIONDATE\"), \"dd-MMM-yy\")` to `to_date(col(\"ACTIVATIONDATE\"), \"dd/MM/yyyy\")`.

**Cell 7: Include Activation Date as an \"Activity\" (Phase 2, Step 8)**
*Correction to original plan: We already have ActivationDate in `client_distinct_activities_df` if first activity = activation. We need to ensure activation date is present as a reference point if no other activity happened on that day. The earlier join and distinct should give us `CLIENTCODE`, `ACTIVATIONDATE`, `ActivityDate`. We want to calculate gaps from `ACTIVATIONDATE` as the first reference point, then between subsequent activities.*

*Revised approach for step 8: We need a baseline \"event\" which is the activation date itself for every client. Then we union actual activity dates.*

```python
# --- Phase 2: Calculate Inter-Activity Gaps ---

```

**Explanation of Changes/Refinements in Phase 2:**

*   **Cell 7 (Step 8 - `all_event_points_with_activation_df`):**
    *   We explicitly create `activation_event_df` which lists `(ClientCode, ActivationDate as ActivityDate)`.
    *   We then take `client_distinct_activities_df` (which has actual trade/login dates post-activation) and select just `(ClientCode, ActivityDate)` for the union.
    *   The `unionByName` and `distinct` operations ensure we have a timeline for each client starting with their activation date, followed by all their unique actual activity dates.
    *   We then join `ActivationDate` back from `client_master_df` because we need it later for calculating total time from activation.
*   **Cell 8 (Steps 9 & 10 - `meaningful_gaps_df`):**
    *   `lag(\"ActivityDate\", 1)` correctly gets the previous point in the timeline.
    *   `datediff(col(\"ActivityDate\"), col(\"Previous_ActivityDate\"))` calculates the gap.
    *   `filter(col(\"Previous_ActivityDate\").isNotNull())`: This is important. The very first \"event point\" for each client (which is their `ActivationDate` if no activity occurred on that day itself) will have a `null` `Previous_ActivityDate`. The `datediff` would be null. We are interested in gaps *between* defined points. So, the first gap we care about is between the *first actual activity* and the `ActivationDate`, or between two actual activities. This filter ensures `Gap_In_Days` is calculated between two valid dates.

Please run these two cells. The output of `meaningful_gaps_df.show()` should display `ClientCode`, `ActivationDate`, the `ActivityDate` (which is the end date of an inactive period), the `Previous_ActivityDate` (start date of that inactive period), and the `Gap_In_Days`.

Let me know the results, and then we'll proceed to Phase 3: Finding Time to First N-Day Inactivity Spell."""),

**Observations from Cell 7 & 8 Outputs:**

*   **Cell 7 (`all_event_points_with_activation_df`):**
    *   The `ActivityDate` correctly starts with the `ActivationDate` for clients where their first actual activity might have been later (or on the same day).
    *   For `ABBA001`, the `ActivationDate` is `2014-10-28`. The first `ActivityDate` shown for it is `2020-08-03`, which means this client was inactive for a very long time after activation before their first trade/login in our dataset. This is correctly captured.
    *   The distinct count of `42,735,506` event points seems reasonable given the number of clients and activities.
*   **Cell 8 (`meaningful_gaps_df`):**
    *   For `ABBA001`:
        *   The first row shows `ActivityDate: 2020-08-03`, `Previous_ActivityDate: 2014-10-28`, `Gap_In_Days: 2106`. This correctly represents the long inactivity spell after activation until the first observed activity in our data.
        *   Subsequent rows show gaps of 1 day, 3 days, etc., representing typical inter-activity periods.
    *   The `Total meaningful gap records: 41,418,995` is also a good number, slightly less than total event points because the very first event point per client doesn't produce a gap with a `Previous_ActivityDate`.

The data is now structured correctly in `meaningful_gaps_df` with each row representing an activity and the duration of the inactive spell *preceding* it. We can now proceed to **Phase 3: Find Time to First N-Day Inactivity Spell.**

**Explanation of Phase 3 (Cells 9 & 10):**

*   **Cell 9 (Step 11):**
    *   It iterates through each `n_days` window (60, 90, 270, 365).
    *   `meaningful_gaps_df.filter(col(\"Gap_In_Days\") >= n_days)`: Finds all inactivity spells of N days or longer.
    *   `row_number().over(window_first_spell)` and `filter(col(\"spell_rank\") == 1)`: For each client, this picks out the *very first time* they experienced an N-day (or longer) inactivity spell.
    *   `Start_First_{n_days}D_Inactivity`: This is the `Previous_ActivityDate` of that first N-day spell, marking when the long inactivity *began*.
    *   `Time_To_First_{n_days}D_Inactivity_Start`: Calculated as `datediff(Start_First_N_Day_Inactivity, ActivationDate)`. This is the number of days from their activation until they *started* their first significant inactivity.
    *   The results for each N are left-joined to `client_survival_times_df`. Clients who never hit that N-day inactivity will have nulls in these new columns.
*   **Cell 10 (Steps 12 & 13):**
    *   `last_activity_df`: We find the `Last_Known_ActivityDate` for every client using the `all_event_points_with_activation_df` (which includes activation date itself if no other activity).
    *   This `Last_Known_ActivityDate` is joined.
    *   For each N-day window:
        *   `Is_Censored_{n_days}D`: Set to `True` if `Time_To_First_{n_days}D_Inactivity_Start` is null (meaning they never experienced that event).
        *   `Censoring_Time_For_{n_days}D`: Calculated as `datediff(Last_Known_ActivityDate, ActivationDate_for_censoring)`. This is the total duration the client was observed without experiencing the N-day inactivity event.
        *   The `Time_To_First_{n_days}D_Inactivity_Start` column is then updated: if censored, it takes the `Censoring_Time_For_{n_days}D`; otherwise, it keeps the original time to event.
        *   A check for negative time (robustness) is added.
    *   `final_client_survival_df`: Selects the relevant columns for the final output.

Please run Cell 9 and Cell 10. The output of Cell 10 should give you a DataFrame where each row is a client, and for each N-day window, you have the time until they started their first N-day inactivity (or their censoring time if they never did) and a flag indicating if they were censored for that window.

                types.Part.from_text(text="""The output from Cell 10 looks plausible, but there's one key aspect we need to carefully examine in the \"Final DataFrame with censoring information\":

For clients where `Is_Censored_XXD` is `true`, the `Time_To_First_XXD_Inactivity_Start` is showing `0`.

*   **Example:** `ABBA1139`, `ActivationDate: 2006-10-19`, `Last_Known_ActivityDate: 2006-10-19`. This client only had activity on their activation day.
    *   `Is_Censored_60D` is `true`.
    *   `Time_To_First_60D_Inactivity_Start` is `0`.
*   This means their `Censoring_Time_For_60D` was calculated as `datediff('2006-10-19', '2006-10-19') = 0`.

**This is correct based on the logic for `Censoring_Time`:** If a client's only activity (or last known activity) was on their activation day, and they never showed an N-day gap after that within our observation window, their \"observed duration without event\" starting from activation is indeed 0 days (if the `Last_Known_ActivityDate` *is* the `ActivationDate`).

However, when we analyze this, a \"time to event\" of 0 for a censored individual means they were essentially observed for 0 days *after activation* without experiencing the event. This group of clients (who only have activity on their activation day and nothing thereafter) is a distinct cohort.

The clients like `AA183BB9` and `AABB1944` showing `Is_Censored_XXD` as `false` and `Time_To_First_XXD_Inactivity_Start` as `0` are more interesting.
This would imply:
`Time_To_First_XXD_Inactivity_Start = datediff(Start_First_XXD_Inactivity, ActivationDate_spell_XXD) = 0`
Which means `Start_First_XXD_Inactivity` (the `Previous_ActivityDate` when the gap started) was *equal* to `ActivationDate_spell_XXD` (their `ActivationDate`). This can only happen if their very first inter-activity gap (the one starting from ActivationDate) was already >= N days.

*   **Example Walkthrough for `AA183BB9` (hypothetical if not censored and time is 0):**
    *   Activation: D_activation
    *   First activity after activation: D_first_activity
    *   Gap = `datediff(D_first_activity, D_activation)`
    *   If this Gap >= N, then `Start_First_N_Day_Inactivity` would be `D_activation`.
    *   `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start` would be `datediff(D_activation, D_activation) = 0`.
    *   This means the client was inactive for N days *immediately following activation* before their first actual trade/login.

This is logically sound. The value `0` for `Time_To_First_XXD_Inactivity_Start` means the N-day inactivity spell began *on their activation day* (i.e., they were inactive for N days right after activating, before their first actual engagement).

Okay, with that understanding, the structure of `final_client_survival_df` is correct. It gives us for each client and each N-day window:
1.  `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start`: The number of days from their activation until they *started* their first N-day (or longer) inactivity spell. If censored, this is their total observation time from activation.
2.  `Is_Censored_N_Day`: A boolean indicating if they were observed for the `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start` duration without ever starting such a spell.

**Explanation of Phase 4 (Cells 11 & 12):**

*   **Cell 11 (Descriptive Statistics):**
    *   Iterates through each N-day window.
    *   Calculates and prints the total clients, number/percentage experiencing the N-day inactivity (event), and number/percentage censored.
    *   For clients who *experienced the event* (not censored), it calculates mean, min, max, and approximate quantiles (25th, 50th-median, 75th, 90th) for the `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start`.
    *   Compiles a summary table of these stats.
*   **Cell 12 (Visualization):**
    *   This cell provides a basic way to visualize the distribution of `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start` for *non-censored* clients using histograms.
    *   **Important:** It includes a check and potential sampling if the number of non-censored clients is very large, as `toPandas()` can cause memory issues.
    *   True Kaplan-Meier plots that properly handle censored data would require a library like `lifelines` and a bit more setup to prepare the data (duration and event/censored status). This histogram gives a first look at the event times.

Please run Cell 11 and Cell 12. The output of Cell 11 will be very informative with the summary statistics. The histograms from Cell 12 will give a visual sense of when clients tend to hit these inactivity milestones."""),

The functions `avg`, `min`, `max` (and others like `count`, `sum`) need to be explicitly imported from `pyspark.sql.functions` or called as `F.avg`, `F.min`, etc., if you import `pyspark.sql.functions as F`.

We did import `avg` in Cell 1:
`from pyspark.sql.functions import col, to_date, lit, lag, datediff, avg, count, when, expr, row_number, broadcast, min as pyspark_min, max as pyspark_max`

The issue might be that the Python kernel/session for Cell 11 somehow doesn't have `avg` in its immediate scope, or there was an issue with the import in Cell 1.

**Let's ensure the imports are explicitly available or re-imported if necessary.**

**Option 1: Re-run Cell 1 (Simplest if it was a transient issue)**
Sometimes, just re-running the first cell where imports are defined can fix this if the kernel state was reset or something unusual happened.

**Option 2: Explicitly import again in Cell 11 (More robust)**

Add this line at the beginning of Cell 11:
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import avg, min as pyspark_min, max as pyspark_max, col # Re-import for safety
```

Let's try **Option 2** for robustness.

Title:
\"Distribution of Time to Start First 60D Inactivity (Non-Censored)\"

X-axis (Horizontal):

Label: “Days from Activation to Start of Inactivity Spell”

Range: Approximately 0 to 1300 days

Interpretation: This measures how many days passed after account activation before the user started a continuous 60-day inactivity period.

Y-axis (Vertical):

Label: “Number of Clients”

Range: 0 to approximately 225,000

Histogram Characteristics:

High Initial Spike:

The first bar is extremely tall, peaking at over 220,000 clients, suggesting the majority of users become inactive very shortly after activation (within the first few days or weeks).

Rapid Decline:

The bar height drops dramatically right after the first bin.

Long Tail:

The distribution stretches out gradually to the right, indicating that a smaller number of clients take much longer (up to ~1300 days) to become inactive.

Non-Censored Data:

Only includes users who did eventually become inactive (i.e., no right-censored data from still-active users).

📈 Second Image: Distribution of Time to Start First 90-Day Inactivity (Non-Censored)
Title:
\"Distribution of Time to Start First 90D Inactivity (Non-Censored)\"

X-axis (Horizontal):

Y-axis (Vertical):

Same label: “Number of Clients”

Range: 0 to approximately 215,000

Histogram Characteristics:

Initial Spike:

Slightly lower than the first image, peaking at just above 210,000.

This shows that slightly fewer users reach 90 days of inactivity right away compared to 60 days, as some users might have had a short activity burst breaking their inactivity before reaching 90 days.

Similar rapid drop after the initial peak.

Let's summarize the key learnings from these visualizations:

**Key Learnings from Histograms (Time to Start of First N-Day Inactivity):**

1.  **High Infant Mortality / Early Disengagement:**
    *   For both 60-day and 90-day inactivity spells, the **vast majority of clients who eventually hit this inactivity state do so very early in their lifecycle** (i.e., `Time_To_First_N_Day_Inactivity_Start` is small, often close to 0).
    *   The extremely tall first bar indicates a large number of clients either:
        *   Activated and *never* engaged significantly, thus hitting the N-day inactivity threshold almost immediately after activation (time to start = 0, meaning the N-day inactivity started on their activation day).
        *   Activated, had a very brief period of activity, and then quickly became inactive for N days.
    *   This is a classic pattern seen in many subscription/engagement services – a significant portion of new sign-ups disengage quickly.

2.  **Rapid Decline After Initial Peak:**
    *   The number of clients starting their first N-day inactivity spell drops off sharply as the \"time from activation\" increases.
    *   This means that if a client makes it past the initial few weeks/months without becoming inactive for N days, their likelihood of starting such an inactivity spell later in their lifecycle (but still eventually doing so) decreases.

3.  **Long Tail of Late Disengagers:**
    *   While fewer in number, there are clients who remain active for extended periods (hundreds or even >1000 days from activation) before they eventually experience their first significant N-day inactivity spell.
    *   These clients represent a different pattern of disengagement – perhaps a gradual fade-out or a significant change in their circumstances or interest much later in their tenure.

4.  **Comparison between 60D and 90D Inactivity:**
    *   The initial spike for 90-day inactivity is slightly lower than for 60-day inactivity.
    *   **Interpretation:** This is expected. It means some clients who might have hit a 60-day inactivity spell early on managed to have at least one activity event *before* that spell extended to 90 continuous days. So, fewer clients make it to the 90-day continuous inactivity mark right at the beginning compared to the 60-day mark.
    *   However, the overall shape of the distribution (high initial peak, rapid decline, long tail) is similar for both, indicating the fundamental pattern of early disengagement being most common.

**Implications for Modeling and Churn Definition:**

*   **Importance of Early Lifecycle Features:** The strong pattern of early disengagement suggests that features related to a client's initial few days/weeks of activity (or lack thereof) post-activation could be highly predictive, especially for shorter churn windows.
*   **Heterogeneity of Churn:** Churn isn't a single phenomenon.
    *   \"Early churners\" (those in the initial spike) might be driven by different factors (e.g., didn't understand the platform, initial promotion ended, unmet expectations from onboarding) than \"late churners\" (those in the long tail).
    *   This reinforces the idea that building models for different churn windows (60D, 90D, 270D, 365D) is valuable, as they might capture these different churner profiles.
*   **Value of Shorter Churn Windows (60D, 90D):** These windows are clearly capturing a significant and early disengagement phenomenon. Models predicting this can allow for timely interventions when clients are just starting to drift away.
*   **Longer Churn Windows (270D, 365D):** While a smaller proportion of clients might take a very long time to hit these, they represent a deeply disengaged segment. The \"time to start N-day inactivity\" for these will likely have an even more pronounced long tail.
*   **Censored Data:** Remember these histograms are for *non-censored* clients (those who *did* experience the N-day event). A large percentage of clients were censored (as per Cell 11 output), meaning they were still \"active\" (had not yet hit that specific N-day inactivity) by the end of our observation period or their last known activity. The true \"survival curves\" (Kaplan-Meier) would incorporate this censored information to give a more complete picture of the probability of remaining active over time.

**Next Steps based on these insights:**

1.  **Review Cell 11 Output:** The descriptive statistics from Cell 11 (mean, median time to event, percentage censored) will complement these visual findings. The median time to event for non-censored clients will likely be very low, confirming the visual spike.
2.  **Consider Visualizing for 270D and 365D (with caution):** If the number of non-censored clients for these longer windows is manageable (after sampling if needed), plotting similar histograms could be insightful, though we expect even more pronounced initial spikes and longer, flatter tails.
3.  **Proceed to Analysis 2 (Trade-only vs. Login-only vs. Combined Inactivity - III.2):** This will help us understand *how* clients become inactive (stop trading first, stop logging in first, or both around the same time) leading up to these N-day inactivity events.

This exploratory analysis has been very fruitful in confirming significant early disengagement patterns!"""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""This output from Cell 11 is extremely telling and dramatically reinforces what the histograms suggested!

Let's dissect these statistics:

**Key Observations from Descriptive Stats (Cell 11):**

1.  **High Percentage of Censored Clients:**
    *   For all N-day windows, a very large majority of clients are \"censored\" (80-86%). This means most clients in your total base did *not* experience the defined N-day inactivity spell (no trade AND no login) within their observed lifetime in your dataset. They were still \"active\" by this definition, or their observation period ended before such an event occurred.

2.  **Dominance of \"Time to Event = 0\" for Non-Censored Clients:**
    *   **Crucial Finding:** For clients who *did* experience an N-day inactivity spell (the non-censored group):
        *   The **Median (50th percentile) Time to Start Inactivity is 0.00 days for ALL windows (60D, 90D, 270D, 365D).**
        *   The **25th Percentile is also 0.00 days.**
        *   The **75th Percentile is also 0.00 days.**
    *   **Interpretation:** This means that for more than 75% of the clients who eventually become inactive for N continuous days (no trade AND no login), that N-day inactivity spell *began on their activation day*. They essentially activated and then showed no meaningful engagement (no trades and no logins) for at least N days right from the start.
    *   This is a very strong \"infant mortality\" signal.

3.  **90th Percentile Behavior:**
    *   **60D Window:** 90th percentile is 74 days. This means 90% of those who hit 60D inactivity started that spell within 74 days of activation. The remaining 10% took longer.
    *   **90D Window:** 90th percentile is 81 days. Similar pattern.
    *   **270D & 365D Windows:** The 90th percentile is **0.00 days**. This is striking. It implies that for at least 90% of clients who eventually become inactive for 270 or 365 continuous days, that extremely long inactivity period *started on their activation day*. The group of clients who become active for a while and *then* disengage for such a long period (270/365 days) is in the remaining <10% of this \"event experienced\" group.

4.  **Mean vs. Median:**
    *   The Mean Time to Start Inactivity is pulled higher than the median (e.g., 32.25 days for 60D window vs. median 0) due to the \"long tail\" of clients who *do* take longer to hit their first N-day inactivity (Max times are >1300 days). This confirms the right-skewed distribution we saw in the histograms.

5.  **Decreasing Mean Time to Event for Longer Windows (270D, 365D):**
    *   Mean for 60D: 32.25 days
    *   Mean for 90D: 35.07 days
    *   Mean for 270D: 23.11 days
    *   Mean for 365D: 14.56 days
    *   This seems counterintuitive at first (why would mean time to start a *longer* inactivity be *shorter*?). It's because the group experiencing these very long inactivity spells (270D, 365D) is even more dominated by those who started this inactivity *immediately at activation* (P90 is 0). The few who become inactive later have less impact on the mean for these very long windows compared to the shorter windows where a slightly larger fraction might have had some initial activity before the N-day spell.

**Overarching Conclusion from This Analysis (I.3):**

*   **The most common pattern for clients who eventually exhibit N-day inactivity (no trades AND no logins for 60, 90, 270, or 365 continuous days) is that this inactivity begins *immediately upon activation*.** They are essentially \"dead on arrival\" in terms of combined trading and login engagement.
*   A smaller fraction of clients become active for some period and *then* transition into these N-day inactivity states.
*   This strongly suggests that your churn prediction models, especially for predicting these combined trade/login inactivity states, will need to heavily weigh features related to:
    *   **Immediate post-activation behavior (or lack thereof).**
    *   Perhaps even pre-activation characteristics if available (though we don't have those here).

**Implications for Modeling:**

*   **Feature Engineering:** Features like \"days active in first X days post-activation,\" \"number of trades in first X days,\" \"number of logins in first X days,\" \"did client engage (trade or login) at all within first Y days\" will likely be very powerful.
*   **Defining \"Engaged Churn\":** Our current churn definition `Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays` has \"Condition A: Client had (Trade_Days_Count_XXXD > 0 OR Login_Days_Count_XXXD > 0) in the XXX days *before* the snapshot.\"
    *   This \"Condition A\" is crucial. It filters out clients who were already in a long inactive state *before* the snapshot. It tries to focus on predicting churn among those who were *recently engaged*.
    *   The current analysis (I.3) looked at the *very first* N-day spell from activation, without pre-filtering for recent engagement. This is why we see so many \"time to event = 0\".
    *   When we build the ABT with the `Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays` target, Condition A will ensure we are looking at a different population than the \"dead on arrival\" group highlighted by this specific survival analysis.
    *   However, the insight that *initial inactivity is a massive risk factor* is still highly relevant for understanding the overall client base.

This is a very strong result. It dramatically underscores the importance of successful onboarding and early engagement.

We should now proceed to **Analysis 2 (Trade-only vs. Login-only vs. Combined Inactivity - III.2)**. This will help us see, for clients who *do* become inactive in our snapshot-based churn definition, what the patterns of stopping trades vs. logins look like."""),

This is a good idea because:

1.  **Different Logic Flow:** Analysis 2 requires a snapshot-based approach, similar to the ABT generation, which is quite different from the event-history/survival analysis style of Analysis 1.
2.  **Focus and Clarity:** A new notebook will keep the code and objectives clear and focused on this specific question.

**Explanation of Phase 1 (Cells 1-4):**

*   **Cell 1:** Standard setup.
*   **Cell 2 (Trades):** Loads trade data, selects `ClientCode` and `ActivityDate` (parsed), and takes `distinct()` because for this analysis, we only care if *any* trade happened on a given day for a client, not how many. Persisted for reuse.
*   **Cell 3 (Logins):** Similar to trades, loads login data, gets distinct `ClientCode` and `ActivityDate`. Persisted.
*   **Cell 4 (Snapshots):**
    *   Determines the overall minimum and maximum activity dates from both trade and login data. This helps define the bounds of our analysis.
    *   Sets a `snapshot_start_date` (e.g., \"2021-01-01\").
    *   Calculates a `snapshot_end_date`. This is crucial: it's set to `overall_max_date - 365 days` (our longest look-forward window). This ensures that for every snapshot taken, we have enough subsequent data to check for activity in the 365 days *after* it.
    *   Uses Pandas `date_range` with `freq='M'` to generate month-end snapshot dates between the start and calculated end.
    *   Converts this list of dates into a Spark DataFrame `snapshots_df`. Persisted.

Please run these first four cells.
**Key things to check:**
1.  Correct loading of trade and login data (counts and sample `show()`).
2.  The `Overall Min/Max Activity Date` printed.
3.  The calculated `Snapshot Start Date` and `Snapshot End Date`.
4.  The number of snapshot dates generated and the first/last few shown.

This setup gives us our distinct activity events and the timeline of snapshots against which we will measure inactivity. Once this is confirmed, we'll move to Phase 2: Generating Client-Snapshot Base and Calculating Forward Activity."""),

    *   Max Activity Date: `2024-04-30`
    *   This gives us a good span of data.

2.  **Snapshot Dates:**
    *   Snapshot Start: `2021-01-01` (as defined)
    *   Snapshot End (calculated for 365-day look-forward): `2023-05-01`.
        *   `2024-04-30` (Max Activity) - `365 days` = `2023-05-01`. This is correct. The last snapshot for which we can fully observe a 365-day window afterwards is `2023-04-30` (month-end before `2023-05-01`).
    *   `Generated 28 snapshot dates`: From Jan 2021 to Apr 2023 (month-ends), this count is correct (12 in 2021 + 12 in 2022 + 4 in 2023 = 28).
    *   The first and last few snapshot dates shown confirm month-end frequency and the calculated range.

3.  **Pandas FutureWarning:**
    *   `FutureWarning: 'M' is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, please use 'ME' instead.`
    *   This is good to note. We should update `freq='M'` to `freq='ME'` for future-proofing, though `'M'` still works for now.

Let's make that minor update to Cell 4 for the Pandas frequency alias and then proceed to Phase 2.

**Explanation of Phase 2 (Cells 5 & 6):**

*   **Cell 5 (Client-Snapshot Base):**
    *   Creates a `client_universe_df` by taking all distinct `ClientCode`s from both trades and logins.
    *   Performs a `crossJoin` between `client_universe_df` and `snapshots_df`. This creates a row for every client for every snapshot date – forming the backbone of our analysis table. This can be a large DataFrame.
*   **Cell 6 (Forward Activity Counts):**
    *   Iterates through each `n_day_window` (60, 90, 270, 365).
    *   For each N:
        *   Calculates `Trade_Days_In_FWD_{n}D`: It joins the client-snapshot base with the `trades_df`. The join conditions ensure we only count distinct trade days for the correct client that fall *strictly after* the `SnapshotDate` and *up to and including* `SnapshotDate + n days`. A left join and `groupBy/agg(countDistinct)` handles clients with no trades in the window (count will be null, then filled to 0).
        *   Calculates `Login_Days_In_FWD_{n}D`: Similar logic for logins.
        *   These calculated count columns are joined back to `activity_features_df`.
        *   `fillna(0)` ensures that if a client had no trades or no logins in the forward window, their count is 0, not null.

This phase might take some time to run, especially Cell 6, due to the joins and aggregations over potentially large DataFrames.

Please execute Cell 5 and Cell 6.
**Check the output for:**
1.  The `Total unique clients in universe` and `Total client-snapshot records`.
2.  A sample of `activity_features_df` showing `ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate`, and the newly created forward trade/login count columns for each N-day window. The counts should be integers."""),

You are already aliasing `trades_df` as `t_df` and `logins_df` as `l_df`. The issue is likely arising because `cs_df` (which is `client_snapshot_base_df`) itself contains `ClientCode` and `SnapshotDate`, and then within the calculation of `forward_trades_count_df` (and `forward_logins_count_df`), you are performing a `groupBy(cs_df.ClientCode, cs_df.SnapshotDate)`.

When you later join `forward_trades_count_df` back to `activity_features_df` (which starts as `cs_df`), Spark might get confused if `activity_features_df` also still has unqualified `ClientCode` and `SnapshotDate` columns from its origin as `cs_df`.

**Key Changes in Corrected Cell 6:**

1.  **Aliasing for Joins and GroupBy:**
    *   `cs_df_aliased = client_snapshot_base_df.alias(\"cs\")`: The base `client_snapshot_base_df` is aliased to \"cs\" *before* the loop.
    *   `t_df_aliased = trades_df.alias(\"trades\")`
    *   `l_df_aliased = logins_df.alias(\"logins\")`
    *   Inside the join and groupBy for calculating `forward_trades_count_df` and `forward_logins_count_df`, we now use qualified column names like `col(\"cs.ClientCode\")`, `col(\"trades.ActivityDate\")`, etc. This explicitly tells Spark which DataFrame's column to use.
2.  **Explicit Join Condition for Aggregated DFs:**
    *   When joining `forward_trades_count_df` (and `_logins_`) back to `activity_features_df`, the join condition is made fully explicit:
        `(activity_features_df.ClientCode == forward_trades_count_df.ClientCode) & (activity_features_df.SnapshotDate == forward_trades_count_df.SnapshotDate)`
    *   `.drop(forward_trades_count_df.ClientCode).drop(forward_trades_count_df.SnapshotDate)`: After the left join, we drop the redundant `ClientCode` and `SnapshotDate` columns that came from `forward_trades_count_df` to avoid having duplicate key columns. This keeps the schema clean.
3.  **Final `select` for `show()`:** Added a `select(expected_cols)` before the `show()` to ensure we only display the columns we intend to see in the final output of this cell, making it cleaner.

This approach should resolve the `AnalysisException: Column ... are ambiguous`. Please replace your Cell 6 with this version and try again."""),

**Key Observations from Cell 5 & 6 Outputs:**

*   **Cell 5:**
    *   `Total unique clients in universe: 358,755` - This is the total number of distinct clients found across your trade and login data.
    *   `Total client-snapshot records: 10,045,140` (358,755 clients * 28 snapshots = 10,045,140). This confirms the cross-join worked as expected.
*   **Cell 6:**
    *   The output shows `ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate`, and the 8 new columns representing forward trade and login day counts for the 60, 90, 270, and 365-day windows.
    *   The values in these columns are integers (0 or more), which is correct. For example:
        *   Client `1001705` on `2021-11-30` had 0 trades in any forward window, 0 logins in the 60/90/270 day forward windows, but 1 login day in the 365-day forward window.
        *   Client `1104408` on `2022-01-31` had 0 trades forward, but increasing numbers of login days in the 90, 270, and 365-day forward windows.
    *   `Total records in activity_features_df: 10045140` - Matches the base.
    *   The list of columns is correct.

The `activity_features_df` now has all the necessary information to categorize the inactivity patterns.

**Explanation of Phase 3 (Cells 7 & 8):**

*   **Cell 7 (Categorize Inactivity):**
    *   Takes the `activity_features_df` from the previous phase.
    *   Iterates through each `n_day_window`.
    *   Uses a series of `when().otherwise()` conditions based on the forward trade and login day counts to assign one of the four categories:
        *   `Stopped_Trading_Only`
        *   `Stopped_Logging_In_Only`
        *   `Stopped_Both` (This corresponds to our predictive churn definition's Condition B)
        *   `Remained_Active_Both`
    *   The new category columns (e.g., `Inactivity_Category_60D`) are added to the DataFrame.
*   **Cell 8 (Aggregate and Analyze):**
    *   Iterates through each `n_day_window`.
    *   For each window, it groups by the corresponding `Inactivity_Category_X_D` column and counts the occurrences.
    *   Calculates the percentage of each category out of the total client-snapshot pairs.
    *   Prints the counts and percentages for each N-day window.
    *   Optionally collects these results into a list `overall_summary_list` which is then converted to a Spark DataFrame for a combined summary display.

Please run Cell 7 and Cell 8.
The output of Cell 7 will show a sample of the DataFrame with the new category columns.
The output of Cell 8 will be the core result of this analysis – the breakdown of client-snapshots into the different inactivity types for each of our defined windows. This will be very insightful!"""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""This is fantastic output from Cells 7 and 8! The results of this inactivity pattern analysis are very clear and provide crucial insights for our churn definition and modeling strategy.

Let's break down these findings:

**Key Observations from Cell 7 (Sample Data):**

*   The categorization logic seems to be working correctly.
    *   `11100319`: `Stopped_Both` across all windows, as all forward counts are 0.
    *   `11100705`: `Stopped_Both` for shorter windows, but `Stopped_Trading_Only` for 365D because there's 1 login in that longer window. This shows how the category can change with the window length.
    *   `11104408`: Progresses from `Stopped_Both` (60D) to `Stopped_Trading_Only` for longer windows as logins appear.
    *   `11106286`: `Stopped_Trading_Only` consistently, as there are logins but no trades in the forward windows.

**Key Insights from Cell 8 (Aggregated Proportions):**

1.  **\"Stopped_Both\" is the Dominant Form of Inactivity (Especially for Shorter Windows):**
    *   **60-Day Window:** A massive **67.98%** of client-snapshots fall into `Stopped_Both` (no trades AND no logins in the next 60 days).
    *   **90-Day Window:** Still very high at **63.88%** for `Stopped_Both`.
    *   This suggests that when clients become inactive, they tend to cease *both* types of engagement relatively quickly.
    *   This validates our refined churn definition (`Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays`) which requires *both* trading and login activity to cease for a client to be labeled as churned.

2.  **\"Stopped_Trading_Only\" is the Next Most Common Inactivity Pattern:**
    *   **60-Day Window:** 10.47%
    *   **365-Day Window:** Increases to 15.32%
    *   This indicates a notable segment of clients who stop trading but continue to log in, at least for some time. The proportion of these clients becomes more pronounced as the window lengthens, suggesting logins might persist longer than trades for some disengaging users. These clients would *not* be considered churned by our current definition but are clearly at high risk.

3.  **\"Stopped_Logging_In_Only\" is Less Common:**
    *   **60-Day Window:** 3.73%
    *   **365-Day Window:** 6.04%
    *   This is the smallest group of partially inactive clients. It means fewer clients continue trading if they've stopped logging in. This makes intuitive sense – logging in is often a prerequisite for trading or managing an account.

4.  **\"Remained_Active_Both\" Increases with Window Length:**
    *   **60-Day Window:** 17.81%
    *   **365-Day Window:** 35.99%
    *   This is logical. It's easier for a client to have at least one trade AND one login over a longer 365-day period than over a shorter 60-day period. The proportion of truly \"inactive on both fronts\" decreases as we give them more time to perform an action.

5.  **Overall High Levels of Inactivity:**
    *   Even for the 365-day window, if we sum up all forms of at least partial inactivity:
        *   `Stopped_Both` (42.66%) + `Stopped_Trading_Only` (15.32%) + `Stopped_Logging_In_Only` (6.04%) = **64.02%**
    *   This means that for any given snapshot, roughly 64% of clients will exhibit some form of inactivity (either no trades, no logins, or neither) over the next year. This underscores the general tendency towards disengagement in the client base over longer periods.

**Implications for Churn Definition & Modeling:**

*   **Validation of \"Stopped_Both\":** The fact that `Stopped_Both` is the most common category, especially for shorter windows, strongly supports using this combined inactivity (no trades AND no logins) as the core of our churn definition. It captures the most prevalent disengagement pattern.
*   **\"Stopped_Trading_Only\" as a High-Risk Group:** Clients who stop trading but keep logging in are a significant segment. While not \"churned\" by our current definition, they are prime candidates for:
    *   Targeted re-engagement campaigns (e.g., \"We miss your trades! Here's a research idea...\").
    *   Potential inclusion in a broader \"at-risk\" model if the business wants to identify clients who have stopped transacting, even if they are still accessing the platform.
*   **Window Selection:**
    *   The high percentage of `Stopped_Both` in the 60-day and 90-day windows suggests these shorter windows are very effective at identifying widespread disengagement early. Models predicting `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` or `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days` could be very actionable.
    *   The 270-day and 365-day windows still capture a large chunk (48% and 43% `Stopped_Both` respectively) and represent a more entrenched form of inactivity.
*   **Feature Engineering Considerations:**
    *   The model might benefit from features that differentiate between a client who has gone completely silent versus one who only stopped one type of activity.
    *   For example, interaction features between recent trade frequency and recent login frequency.

**Summary of Exploratory Work So Far:**

1.  **Inter-Trade Time (00_explore_inter_trade_time.ipynb):** Showed very frequent trading for most active periods (median 2 days between trades), highlighting that even short periods of trading inactivity are significant deviations.
2.  **Time to N-Day Inactivity (01_explore_time_to_inactivity.ipynb):** Revealed that for clients who eventually experience N days of *combined* inactivity (no trades AND no logins), this inactivity most often starts *immediately upon activation*. This is a critical \"infant mortality\" pattern.
3.  **Inactivity Patterns (02_explore_inactivity_patterns.ipynb):** Demonstrated that \"Stopped_Both\" (no trades AND no logins) is the most common form of future inactivity for client-snapshots, validating our churn definition. It also highlighted \"Stopped_Trading_Only\" as a significant secondary pattern.

These three analyses provide a very strong foundation and rationale for:
*   Our refined churn definition (requiring recent engagement then complete future inactivity of both trades and logins).
*   The choice of multiple churn windows (60D, 90D, 270D, 365D) to capture different stages/types of disengagement.
*   Potential feature engineering directions (focus on early lifecycle, differentiating activity types).

This exploratory phase has been highly valuable! We now have a much clearer, data-driven understanding of the behavior we are trying to model.

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, let's discuss adding these two payout-related fields to the ABT. This is an interesting idea aimed at capturing a potential high-risk signal.

**Proposed New Fields:**

1.  **`Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`**: (`Payout_Amount_Snapshot` / `Cash_Balance_At_Snapshot_Time`) * 100
2.  **`Payout_Risk_Flag`**: \"CHURNRISK\" if `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance` > 70%, else Null or \"LOWRISK\".

**Is this practice good?**

Conceptually, **yes, this can be a good practice and a potentially powerful feature**, because a client withdrawing a very large portion of their available cash balance could indeed be a strong indicator of intent to disengage or churn.

**However, there are critical practical considerations and data requirements:**

1.  **Availability of Historical Cash Balance Data:**
    *   **CRITICAL:** To calculate `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance` accurately for each historical snapshot in our ABT (2021-01-01 to 2023-12-31), we **must have the client's historical cash balance *at the time of (or just before) each snapshot date***.
    *   Do we have a data source for this? (e.g., `biuser.tblclientcashbalance_daily` or similar, providing `CLIENTCODE`, `Date`, `CashBalance`).
    *   If we only have payout amounts but not the corresponding cash balance, we cannot calculate this percentage.

2.  **Timing of Payout and Cash Balance Measurement:**
    *   The \"cash balance at that time\" needs to be clearly defined. Is it the balance *before* the payout request is processed, or *after*?
    *   Ideally, it should be the balance *just before* the payout was requested or approved for the snapshot period.
    *   If a client makes multiple payouts in a snapshot period (e.g., a month), how do we handle this? Do we consider the largest payout percentage, or the sum of payouts against the average/start-of-period balance?

3.  **Defining \"Payout at that time\" for a Snapshot:**
    *   Our ABT is built on snapshots (e.g., end-of-month). A payout can happen any day within that month.
    *   **Option A (Simpler):** For a given snapshot (e.g., end of Jan 2021), we could sum all approved payout amounts for that client *during January 2021*. Then, we'd need the cash balance as of, say, Jan 1st, 2021, or an average for January.
    *   **Option B (More Granular, if data allows):** If we have daily cash balances and daily payout data, we could try to link each payout event to the balance immediately preceding it. This is more complex for a snapshot-based ABT. For a snapshot ABT, summing payouts over the snapshot lookback period (e.g., last 30 days before snapshot) and comparing against the cash balance at the *start* of that 30-day period (or at the snapshot date itself, if that's how balance is recorded) is more typical.

4.  **The 70% Threshold:**
    *   Is 70% a business-defined rule, or an arbitrary starting point? It's fine as a starting point, but its effectiveness as a \"CHURNRISK\" flag would need to be evaluated. The raw percentage itself (`Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`) is likely a more informative continuous feature for the model. The binarized flag can be useful for direct interpretation or rule-based alerts.

5.  **Lookahead Bias Potential (Minor, but consider):**
    *   If `Cash_Balance_At_Snapshot_Time` is taken *after* a payout within the snapshot's \"current period\" has occurred, it might slightly distort the percentage. Using cash balance *before* any payouts of the current snapshot period is ideal.

**How to Integrate if Data is Available (assuming monthly snapshots and historical daily/monthly cash balance):**

Let's assume we want to calculate this for features looking back from the `SnapshotDate` (e.g., payouts in the last 30 days).

1.  **In `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`:**
2.  **Load Historical Cash Balance Data:** Read the data source containing `CLIENTCODE`, `Date`, `CashBalance`.
3.  **Load Payout Data:** We already load `payout_data.txt` (`ClientCode`, `PayoutDate`, `ApprovedAmount`).
4.  **For each Client-Snapshot:**
    *   **Determine relevant Payout Period:** E.g., for `SnapshotDate` 2021-01-31, the payout period could be 2021-01-01 to 2021-01-31 (or last 30 days: 2021-01-02 to 2021-01-31).
    *   **Sum Payouts in Period:** For each client-snapshot, sum `ApprovedAmount` from `payout_data.txt` where `PayoutDate` falls within this period. Let this be `Total_Payout_In_Period`.
    *   **Get Cash Balance:** For each client-snapshot, retrieve the `CashBalance` as of the `SnapshotDate` (or the start of the payout period, e.g., 2021-01-01). This requires joining with the historical cash balance data. Handle cases where balance might be missing.
    *   **Calculate `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`**:
        ```python
        # Ensure CashBalance is not zero to avoid division by zero
        when(col(\"CashBalance_At_Snapshot\") > 0, (col(\"Total_Payout_In_Period\") / col(\"CashBalance_At_Snapshot\")) * 100) \\
        .otherwise(None) # Or 0, or a very high number if payout > 0 and balance = 0
        ```
    *   **Create `Payout_Risk_Flag`**:
        ```python
        when(col(\"Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance\") > 70, \"CHURNRISK\") \\
        .otherwise(\"LOWRISK\") # Or null
        ```

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Confirm Cash Balance Data:** **This is the absolute first step.** Without historical cash balance data aligned with clients and dates, this feature cannot be built as described.
2.  **If Data Exists:**
    *   The raw percentage (`Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`) is a good continuous feature to add.
    *   The \"CHURNRISK\" flag is also good for interpretability and can be tested as a binary feature.
    *   Define the lookback period for payouts (e.g., payouts in the 30 days leading up to the snapshot) and the exact timing of the cash balance to be used (e.g., balance at the start of that 30-day period, or balance at the snapshot date).

If you can confirm the availability and structure of historical cash balance data, we can then detail the PySpark implementation steps within `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`. If not, this specific feature idea will have to be deferred."""),

Let's address your question: **\"If payout is given in a month, how do we use CASHBAL for percentage? Should it be cashbal at the end of last month or something else?\"**

Given that you have **EOM Cash Balance data**, and our snapshots are also **EOM dates**, here's the most practical and logical approach:

**Proposed Logic:**

1.  **Snapshot Date:** Let's say our `SnapshotDate` is `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2021-01-31`).
2.  **Payout Period:** Consider all approved payouts for the client that occurred *during the month of the snapshot*.
    *   For `SnapshotDate = 2021-01-31`, this would be payouts from `2021-01-01` to `2021-01-31`.
3.  **Cash Balance for Denominator:** Use the **EOM cash balance from the *previous* month**.
    *   For `SnapshotDate = 2021-01-31`, we would use the `CashBalance` as of `2020-12-31`.
    *   **Rationale:** This `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth` represents the starting capital available to the client at the beginning of the current snapshot month, *before* any of the current month's payouts occurred. This avoids the issue of the cash balance already being reduced by the payouts we are measuring. It gives a clearer picture of what proportion of their *starting* available cash they withdrew during the month.

**Detailed Calculation Steps within `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`:**

(This would happen after the client-snapshot base is created, and alongside other feature calculations)

1.  **Load EOM Cash Balance Data:**
    *   Assume a file like `eom_cash_balance.txt` with `CLIENTCODE`, `BalanceDate` (EOM), `CashBalance`.
    *   Read this into a DataFrame, let's call it `eom_cash_bal_df`.
    *   Parse `BalanceDate` to DateType.

2.  **Load Payout Data (already planned):**
    *   `payout_data_txt` read into `payouts_df` (`ClientCode`, `PayoutDate`, `ApprovedAmount`).

3.  **For each Client-Snapshot in your ABT (e.g., `abt_df`):**
    *   `abt_df` has `ClientCode` and `SnapshotDate` (which is an EOM date).

    *   **a. Calculate Total Payouts in Snapshot Month:**
        *   Define `StartOfMonth = trunc(SnapshotDate, \"MM\")` (first day of the snapshot month).
        *   Define `EndOfMonth = SnapshotDate`.
        *   Left join `abt_df` with `payouts_df` where `payouts_df.ClientCode == abt_df.ClientCode` AND `payouts_df.PayoutDate >= StartOfMonth` AND `payouts_df.PayoutDate <= EndOfMonth`.
        *   Group by `abt_df.ClientCode`, `abt_df.SnapshotDate` and `sum(payouts_df.ApprovedAmount)`. Let this be `Total_Payout_In_Snapshot_Month`. Fill null sums with 0.

    *   **b. Get EOM Cash Balance from Previous Month:**
        *   Calculate `PreviousMonthEOM = add_months(trunc(SnapshotDate, \"MM\"), -1) + expr(\"INTERVAL 1 MONTH - INTERVAL 1 DAY\")` (a bit complex, simpler might be `date_sub(trunc(SnapshotDate, \"MM\"), 1)` if your `trunc` gives first of month and then `last_day` function if available or other date math to get last day of previous month).
            *   *Simpler Spark SQL way to get last day of previous month:* `last_day(add_months(SnapshotDate, -1))`
        *   Let `PreviousMonthEOM_Snapshot = last_day(add_months(SnapshotDate, -1))`.
        *   Left join `abt_df` with `eom_cash_bal_df` where `eom_cash_bal_df.ClientCode == abt_df.ClientCode` AND `eom_cash_bal_df.BalanceDate == PreviousMonthEOM_Snapshot`.
        *   Let this be `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth`. Handle cases where this balance might be missing (e.g., new client, no previous month balance).

    *   **c. Calculate `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`:**
        ```python
        # In abt_df after joins
        abt_df = abt_df.withColumn(
            \"Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance\",
            when((col(\"CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth\").isNotNull()) & (col(\"CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth\") > 0),
                 (col(\"Total_Payout_In_Snapshot_Month\") / col(\"CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth\")) * 100)
            .otherwise(None) # Or 0 if preferred when balance is 0 or unknown
        )
        ```
        If `Total_Payout_In_Snapshot_Month > 0` and `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth == 0`, you might assign a very high percentage (e.g., 99999) or handle as per business logic. If `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth` is null, the percentage will be null.

    *   **d. Create `Payout_Risk_Flag`:**
        ```python
        abt_df = abt_df.withColumn(
            \"Payout_Risk_Flag\",
            when(col(\"Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance\") > 70, \"CHURNRISK\")
            .otherwise(None) # Or \"LOWRISK\" if you want to explicitly state it
        )
        ```

**Advantages of this approach:**

*   **Uses Available Data:** Directly leverages your EOM cash balance data and EOM snapshots.
*   **Causally Sound:** Compares current month's payouts to the starting capital from the previous month's end, which is logical.
*   **Consistent:** Applies the same logic across all snapshots.

**Potential Edge Cases/Refinements:**

*   **Client's First Month:** For a client whose `ActivationDate` is in the current snapshot month, they won't have a \"previous month EOM cash balance.\" The percentage will be null. This is acceptable.
*   **Missing Previous EOM Balance:** If, for some reason, a client has activity but their previous EOM balance is missing from your `eom_cash_bal_df`, the percentage will also be null.
*   **Zero Previous EOM Balance:** If `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth` is 0 and `Total_Payout_In_Snapshot_Month` is > 0 (which shouldn't happen if payouts require funds), how do you want to represent the percentage? The current logic makes it null. You could make it a very large number to signify high risk, or keep it null.

This logic for using the previous month's EOM cash balance is the most robust and interpretable given your data constraints.

**ABT Generation Plan for `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`**

**Overall Flow:**

1.  **Setup:** SparkSession, imports, define paths, constants (like N-day windows for churn).
2.  **Data Loading:**
    *   Client Master (`client_details.txt`)
    *   Trade Data (`trade_data.txt`)
    *   Login Data (`LOGIN_*.txt`)
    *   Deposit Data (`deposit_data.txt`)
    *   Payout Data (`payout_data.txt`)
    *   **NEW:** EOM Cash Balance Data (`eom_cash_balance.txt` - need filename and structure)
3.  **Snapshot Date Generation:**
    *   Determine overall min/max activity dates.
    *   Generate month-end snapshot dates from 2021-01-01 up to (Max Activity Date - 365 days).
4.  **Client Universe & Base ABT Structure:**
    *   Get all unique `ClientCode`s.
    *   Cross-join unique clients with snapshot dates.
5.  **Feature Engineering (for each Client-Snapshot):**
    *   **Client Master Features:**
        *   Join `ActivationDate`.
        *   Calculate `Tenure_Days` (SnapshotDate - ActivationDate).
    *   **Recency Features (Days Since Last...):**
        *   `Days_Since_Last_Trade`
        *   `Days_Since_Last_Login`
        *   `Days_Since_Last_Deposit`
        *   `Days_Since_Last_Payout`
        *   (Calculated by finding max activity date <= SnapshotDate).
    *   **Frequency Features (Counts in Lookback Periods):**
        *   For lookback periods like 30, 90, 180, 270, 365 days *before* SnapshotDate:
            *   `Trade_Days_Count_X_D`
            *   `Login_Days_Count_X_D`
            *   `Deposit_Count_X_D`
            *   `Payout_Count_X_D`
            *   `Deposit_Transactions_X_D` (if distinct transactions vs days needed)
            *   `Payout_Transactions_X_D`
    *   **Monetary Features (Sums in Lookback Periods):**
        *   For lookback periods like 30, 90, 180, 270, 365 days *before* SnapshotDate:
            *   `Gross_Brokerage_Sum_X_D`
            *   `Deposit_Amount_Sum_X_D`
            *   `Payout_Amount_Sum_X_D`
    *   **Funding Flow Features:**
        *   `Net_Funding_Flow_X_D` (Deposits - Payouts for lookback X_D).
        *   Ratios like `Payout_To_Deposit_Ratio_X_D`.
    *   **Delta Features (Change over time):**
        *   E.g., Change in `Trade_Days_Count_90D` from (current 90D lookback vs. previous non-overlapping 90D lookback).
        *   Change in `Login_Days_Count_90D`.
        *   Change in `Gross_Brokerage_Sum_90D`.
    *   **NEW Payout Risk Features:**
        *   Get `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth` by joining with EOM cash balance data (based on `last_day(add_months(SnapshotDate, -1))`).
        *   Calculate `Total_Payout_In_Snapshot_Month` (sum of payouts between `trunc(SnapshotDate, \"MM\")` and `SnapshotDate`).
        *   Calculate `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`.
        *   Create `Payout_Risk_Flag`.
6.  **Churn Label Generation (Target Variables):**
    *   For N = 60, 90, 270, 365 days:
        *   **Condition A (Recent Engagement - Lookback):**
            *   `Trade_Days_Count_N_D_Lookback > 0` OR `Login_Days_Count_N_D_Lookback > 0` (using features calculated in step 5 for the N days *before* SnapshotDate).
        *   **Condition B (Subsequent Inactivity - Look Forward):**
            *   Calculate `Trade_Days_In_Churn_Window_N <= 0` (trades in N days *after* SnapshotDate).
            *   Calculate `Login_Days_In_Churn_Window_N <= 0` (logins in N days *after* SnapshotDate).
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_N_Days = 1` if Condition A AND Condition B are true, else 0.
7.  **Final Filtering & Column Selection:**
    *   Filter out snapshots where tenure is too short (e.g., < 90 days, if desired, or where prediction isn't meaningful).
    *   Select the final set of features and the four target labels.
    *   Handle any remaining `null` values in feature columns (e.g., fill with 0, mean, median, or a specific indicator value like -1, depending on the feature). The `fillna` for `Gross_Brokerage_Sum_30D` (and similar) from the previous issue needs to be addressed here.
8.  **ABT Saving:**
    *   Save the final ABT DataFrame to Parquet format.
    *   Use `mode(\"overwrite\")` to replace any existing ABT at the specified path.
    *   Path: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet`

**Key PySpark Implementation Aspects for `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`:**

*   **Window Functions:** Extensively used for:
    *   Calculating recency (max date over a partition).
    *   Calculating sums/counts over rolling/lookback windows (e.g., `sum(...) over (Window.partitionBy(\"ClientCode\").orderBy(cast_snapshot_to_long).rowsBetween(-X_days_equivalent, Window.currentRow))`).
    *   Calculating deltas (using `lag` over snapshots).
*   **Joins:**
    *   Client Master to base ABT.
    *   Activity data (trades, logins, deposits, payouts, EOM cash balance) to the base ABT for feature calculation, often on `ClientCode` and date range conditions.
*   **Date Manipulations:** `to_date`, `datediff`, `add_months`, `date_add`, `date_sub`, `trunc`, `last_day`.
*   **Conditional Logic:** `when().otherwise()` for flags, categorizations, and null handling.
*   **Aggregations:** `groupBy().agg(...)` for summing payouts, counting activities.
*   **Caching/Persisting:** Judicious use of `persist()` or `cache()` on intermediate DataFrames that are reused multiple times (e.g., client-snapshot base before feature engineering, activity data if joined multiple times).
*   **Performance Considerations:**
    *   Broadcast smaller DataFrames (like client master, snapshot dates if small enough) in joins.
    *   Ensure proper data types, especially for join keys and dates.
    *   Filter data as early as possible.

**Regarding the Overwrite:**

The line for saving the ABT will be:
```python
output_abt_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred'
output_file_name_base = \"predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023\"
output_path_parquet = os.path.join(output_abt_dir, f\"{output_file_name_base}.parquet\")

# Ensure the output directory exists
if not os.path.exists(output_abt_dir) and google_drive_base_path: # Check if it's a GDrive path
    os.makedirs(output_abt_dir) 
elif not os.path.exists(output_abt_dir) and not google_drive_base_path: # Local path
     os.makedirs(output_abt_dir)


final_abt_df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(output_path_parquet)
print(f\"ABT successfully saved to: {output_path_parquet}\")
```
The `mode(\"overwrite\")` will indeed ensure that if the Parquet directory at `output_path_parquet` already exists, it will be deleted and replaced with the new ABT.

**Before we proceed with detailing the code for `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`:**

1.  **EOM Cash Balance Data:** Please provide the filename and column structure (names, data types, date format for balance date) for your End-of-Month cash balance data.
2.  **Confirmation of Lookback Periods for Features:** Are the 30, 90, 180, 270, 365 day lookbacks for frequency/monetary features still what you want?
3.  **Delta Feature Specifics:** Which specific delta features are most important? (e.g., 90-day deltas for trade/login/brokerage count/sum).

Once I have the EOM cash balance details, we can start structuring the code for `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`. The previous `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` we were working on had a good start for many of these features, and we'll integrate the new requirements."""),

Here's how you can approach checking if clients identified as \"churned\" in your ABT (which has snapshots up to April 2023) were *actually* inactive in the subsequent period (e.g., May 2023 - April 2024, covering the rest of FY23-24).

**Understanding the Timeline:**

*   **ABT Snapshot End Date:** Your last snapshot in the ABT is `2023-04-30`.
*   **Churn Prediction Window:** For a client snapshot on `2023-04-30`:
    *   `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days=1` means they were predicted to be inactive from `2023-05-01` to `2023-06-29`.
    *   `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days=1` means inactive from `2023-05-01` to `2023-07-29`.
    *   `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days=1` means inactive from `2023-05-01` to `2024-01-25`.
    *   `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days=1` means inactive from `2023-05-01` to `2024-04-29`.
*   **Validation Period:** FY23-24 effectively covers up to `2024-03-31` or `2024-04-30` depending on your fiscal year exact end. Your available activity data goes up to `2024-04-30`.

**Method for Validation:**

You will perform a separate analysis, conceptually an \"out-of-time validation\" for the churn labels generated by your ABT script.

1.  **Identify \"Predicted Churners\" from the Last Relevant Snapshots:**
    *   Load your generated ABT (`predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet`).
    *   Focus on the latest snapshots where a full churn window can be observed within your available data. For example, to validate the `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` label:
        *   The snapshot date would need to be around `2023-04-30` (or earlier if your max activity date was earlier when you *generated* the ABT initially). Since your max activity date is `2024-04-30`, a snapshot on `2023-04-30` allows a full 365-day look forward.
    *   Select clients who have `Is_Churned_Engage_N_Days = 1` for a chosen N and a chosen `SnapshotDate`.
        *   Example: Clients with `SnapshotDate = '2023-04-30'` and `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days = 1`.

2.  **Gather Actual Activity Data for the Validation Period:**
    *   Load your raw `trade_data.txt` and `LOGIN_*.txt` files again. This time, ensure you are loading data that covers the period *after* the snapshot date and through the end of the churn window you are validating.
    *   For our example (snapshot `2023-04-30`, 365-day churn): You need activity data from `2023-05-01` to `2024-04-29`. Your data up to `2024-04-30` covers this perfectly.

3.  **Check Actual Activity for the Identified \"Predicted Churners\":**
    *   For each client identified in Step 1:
        *   Check if they had any trades between `SnapshotDate + 1 day` and `SnapshotDate + N days`.
        *   Check if they had any logins between `SnapshotDate + 1 day` and `SnapshotDate + N days`.
    *   **Actual Churn Status (Validation):**
        *   If a \"predicted churner\" had NO trades AND NO logins in that N-day forward window, then your ABT's churn label was correct for that instance.
        *   If they had *any* trade OR *any* login, then your ABT's churn label was incorrect (a false positive for churn).

4.  **Calculate Accuracy of Churn Labels:**
    *   You can calculate how many of your ABT's `Is_Churned_Engage_N_Days = 1` instances were actually inactive.
    *   Similarly, you can take a sample of clients for whom `Is_Churned_Engage_N_Days = 0` on `2023-04-30` and verify if they indeed had activity in the subsequent N days.

**Example Scenario for Validation (365-Day Churn):**

*   **ABT Snapshot:** Take `ClientCode`, `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` where `SnapshotDate = '2023-04-30'`.
*   **Identify Clients of Interest:**
    *   Cohort 1: Clients with `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days = 1`.
    *   Cohort 2 (for checking non-churn): Clients with `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days = 0`.
*   **Validation Period:** `2023-05-01` to `2024-04-29`.
*   **Validation Check for Cohort 1:**
    *   For each client in Cohort 1, query `trades_df` and `logins_df` for any activity within the validation period.
    *   If no activity found -> ABT label confirmed.
    *   If activity found -> ABT label disconfirmed.
*   **Validation Check for Cohort 2:**
    *   For each client in Cohort 2, query activity.
    *   If activity found -> ABT label confirmed.
    *   If no activity found -> ABT label disconfirmed (false negative for churn from the label's perspective, though the label might be correct by definition if Condition A wasn't met).

**Practical Implementation:**

*   This validation would typically be done in a **new, separate notebook** after the ABT is generated.
*   You'd load the ABT, filter for specific snapshots/clients.
*   You'd load the raw activity data.
*   Perform joins and aggregations to check for activity in the forward periods.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Sanity Check:** It confirms that the complex logic in your ABT generation script for creating churn labels is working as expected and reflecting actual future inactivity.
*   **Trust in Labels:** It builds confidence in the target variable your model will be trained on. If the labels themselves are not accurate representations of future behavior, the model will learn incorrect patterns.
*   **Understanding Data Limits:** If your `overall_max_date` used for snapshot generation was, say, `2023-08-31` when you built the ABT, then for a 365-day churn window, the latest snapshot you could reliably label would be around `2022-08-31`. The validation would then use data from Sep 2022 to Aug 2023. Your current `overall_max_date` of `2024-04-30` is good as it allows full validation for snapshots up to a year prior.

This validation step is crucial for data quality and ensuring the integrity of your modeling process. It's distinct from model performance evaluation; it's about verifying the correctness of the *ground truth* labels your model will learn from."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Let's determine the latest snapshot date for which you can reliably generate the `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` label.

**Given:**

1.  **Overall Max Activity Date available in your raw data:** `2024-04-30`. This is the last day for which you have trade or login information.
2.  **Churn Window for `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`:** We need to observe 60 days *after* the `SnapshotDate` to see if the client had any activity (trades or logins).
3.  **Snapshots are Month-End Dates.**

**Calculation:**

To have a full 60-day observation window *after* a snapshot, the snapshot date plus 60 days must be less than or equal to your overall max activity date.

*   Let `SnapshotDate` be `S`.
*   We need `S + 60 days <= 2024-04-30`.
*   Therefore, the latest possible `S` is `2024-04-30 - 60 days`.

Let's calculate `2024-04-30 - 60 days`:
*   `2024-04-30` minus 30 days (April) = `2024-03-31`
*   `2024-03-31` minus 30 days (approx for March, remaining 30 days) = `2024-03-01` (approx.)
    *   More precisely:
        *   April has 30 days. `2024-04-30` minus 30 days is `2024-03-31`.
        *   We need to subtract another 30 days. March has 31 days.
        *   `2024-03-31` minus 30 days is `2024-03-01`.

So, the latest date for which activity can be *fully observed* for a 60-day window is `2024-03-01`.

Since your snapshots are **month-end dates**, the latest snapshot date `S` must be such that `S` is a month-end date and `S <= 2024-03-01`.

The month-end dates around this period are:
*   ...
*   `2024-01-31`
*   `2024-02-29` (2024 is a leap year)
*   `2024-03-31` (This is too late, as `2024-03-31 + 60 days` would go into May/June 2024, beyond your data)

Let's check `2024-02-29`:
*   `SnapshotDate = 2024-02-29`
*   Look-forward period starts: `2024-03-01`
*   Look-forward period ends: `2024-02-29 + 60 days`
    *   March has 31 days. `2024-02-29 + 31 days (March)` = `2024-03-31` (if we count March 1st as day 1 after Feb 29th)
    *   Let's count days:
        *   March: 31 days
        *   April: 29 days needed to make 60 days (`60 - 31 = 29`)
    *   So, the 60-day window ends on `2024-04-29`.
*   Since `2024-04-29` is less than or equal to your max data date `2024-04-30`, you can fully observe this 60-day window.

Therefore, the latest snapshot date for which you can generate `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` is **`2024-02-29`**.

**In your snapshot generation logic (Cell 4 of `02_explore_inactivity_patterns.ipynb` or the main `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`):**

The `snapshot_end_date` was calculated as `pd.to_datetime(overall_max_date) - pd.Timedelta(days=max_prediction_window)`.
If `max_prediction_window` is set to the *longest* window you are calculating labels for (e.g., 365 days), then this `snapshot_end_date` will be earlier.

*   For `max_prediction_window = 365`: `snapshot_end_date = 2024-04-30 - 365 days = 2023-05-01`. The last snapshot generated was `2023-04-30`.
    *   For `SnapshotDate = 2023-04-30`, the 60-day look-forward ends `2023-06-29`. This is well within `2024-04-30`.

If you generate snapshots based on the `max_prediction_window = 365`, your latest snapshot in the ABT will be `2023-04-30`. For *this specific snapshot*, you can indeed calculate `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` because the required 60-day future window (`2023-05-01` to `2023-06-29`) is fully covered by your available data (which extends to `2024-04-30`).

**Conclusion:**

If your ABT snapshot generation uses the `max_prediction_window = 365` (as it currently does to determine `snapshot_end_date`), then the latest snapshot date in your ABT will be **`2023-04-30`**. You can calculate all four churn labels (`Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`, `_90Days`, `_270Days`, `_365Days`) for this snapshot date because your raw data extends far enough (`2024-04-30`)."""),

Let's refine this slightly for maximum clarity:

**Your Plan:**

1.  **ABT Generation:**
    *   Your `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` script will create snapshots.
    *   The snapshot generation logic (as seen in `02_explore_inactivity_patterns.ipynb`, Cell 4) currently uses `max_prediction_window = 365` days.
    *   With `overall_max_date = 2024-04-30`, the `snapshot_end_date` for generation is `2024-04-30 - 365 days = 2023-05-01`.
    *   This means the **latest month-end snapshot included in your ABT will be `2023-04-30`**.

2.  **Churn Label Calculation for `SnapshotDate = 2023-04-30`:**
    *   For the snapshot `2023-04-30`, your ABT script will calculate:
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` (looks forward to `2023-06-29`)
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days` (looks forward to `2023-07-29`)
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` (looks forward to `2024-01-25`)
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` (looks forward to `2024-04-29`)
    *   All these look-forward periods are *within* your available raw data limit (`2024-04-30`), so these labels can be correctly generated.

3.  **Model Training & Prediction (Conceptual):**
    *   You will likely train your model on data up to a certain point (e.g., snapshots up to end of 2022 or early 2023) to create a \"hold-out\" or \"test\" period.
    *   Let's say you decide your **final \"prediction point\" for out-of-time validation is indeed around `2023-03-31`**.
        *   You would train your model using data *before* this date (e.g., snapshots from 2021-01-31 to `2023-02-28` or even further back, depending on your train/test split strategy).
        *   Then, you would use this trained model to make predictions on the client snapshots for `SnapshotDate = 2023-03-31`.
        *   The model will predict, for example, `Predicted_Churn_Prob_365Days` for clients at `2023-03-31`.

4.  **Validation (\"Checking Accuracy\"):**
    *   You want to see how well the model's predictions for `SnapshotDate = 2023-03-31` align with actual client behavior in the subsequent year (which largely falls into FY23-24).
    *   **For `SnapshotDate = 2023-03-31`:**
        *   The actual behavior window for a 365-day churn definition would be `2023-04-01` to `2024-03-31`.
        *   This entire period is within your available raw data (`up to 2024-04-30`).
    *   **Validation Steps:**
        *   Take clients for whom your model made a prediction on `2023-03-31`.
        *   Compare the model's prediction (e.g., predicted churned/not churned for 365 days) against the *actual* churn status derived by checking their trades and logins between `2023-04-01` and `2024-03-31`.
        *   This allows you to calculate standard model performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR) on this out-of-time test set.

**So, yes, your statement is correct with these clarifications:**

*   Your ABT will contain snapshots up to `2023-04-30`, with churn labels correctly generated for them.
*   If you choose `2023-03-31` as your \"prediction point\" for a specific validation exercise, you can indeed use the subsequent actual behavior in FY23-24 (specifically, `2023-04-01` to `2024-03-31` for a 365-day window) to validate your model's predictions made for that `2023-03-31` snapshot.

This is a sound approach for assessing how well your model generalizes to unseen future data. The key is to ensure your training data strictly precedes your chosen validation snapshot date."""),

1.  **Last Snapshot Date in your ABT:**
    As per our discussion and the snapshot generation logic (`overall_max_date = 2024-04-30`, `max_prediction_window = 365 days`), the latest snapshot date in your generated ABT will be **`2023-04-30`**.

2.  **Churn Label Calculation for `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` on Snapshot `2023-04-30`:**
    *   **Snapshot Date:** `2023-04-30`
    *   **Churn Definition (Condition B - Subsequent Inactivity):** The client must have (NO trades AND NO logins) in the 365 days *after* the snapshot date.
    *   **Look-Forward Period for Inactivity:** This period starts on `2023-05-01` and ends on `2023-04-30 + 365 days = 2024-04-29`.

3.  **Data Used to Determine Actual Inactivity for this Label:**
    *   To determine if a client active around `2023-04-30` actually had no trades and no logins between `2023-05-01` and `2024-04-29`, your ABT generation script will look at your raw trade and login data files.
    *   The period `2023-05-01` to `2024-04-29` falls squarely within your stated FY23-24.
    *   Your available raw data extends up to `2024-04-30`, which perfectly covers this required look-forward period.

**Therefore, for the churn label `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` associated with the very last snapshot in your ABT (`2023-04-30`), the determination of whether a client was actually inactive (Condition B) will indeed be based on their activity (or lack thereof) during the FY23-24 period (specifically May 1, 2023, to April 29, 2024).**

This also means that when you train your model:

*   If you use snapshots up to, say, `2022-12-31` for training.
*   And then test/validate your model on snapshots from `2023-01-31` to `2023-04-30`.
*   The \"ground truth\" churn labels for these test/validation snapshots (especially the later ones like `2023-04-30`) are being determined by looking at actual client behavior that occurred well into FY23-24.

Here's a breakdown:

**Scenario 1: Validating Predictions for `SnapshotDate = 2023-03-31`**

*   **Model Prediction Point:** You train a model on data *before* `2023-03-31`. The model makes predictions for clients based on their state as of `2023-03-31`.
*   **Target Variable Example:** Let's focus on `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`.
*   **Actual Behavior Window (for this snapshot):** The 365 days *after* `2023-03-31` is from `2023-04-01` to `2024-03-31`.
*   **Accuracy Check Data:** You will use your raw activity data (trades and logins) from `2023-04-01` to `2024-03-31` (which falls within FY23-24) to determine the *actual* churn status for these clients.
*   **This is perfectly fine and as discussed.**

**Scenario 2: Validating Predictions for `SnapshotDate = 2022-03-31`**

*   **Model Prediction Point:** You train a model on data *before* `2022-03-31`. The model makes predictions for clients based on their state as of `2022-03-31`.
*   **Target Variable Example:** Again, let's use `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`.
*   **Actual Behavior Window (for this snapshot):** The 365 days *after* `2022-03-31` is from **`2022-04-01` to `2023-03-31`**.
*   **Accuracy Check Data:** You will use your raw activity data (trades and logins) from **`2022-04-01` to `2023-03-31`** to determine the *actual* churn status for these clients.

**Clarification on \"accuracy check will be the same as for snapshot 2023-04-30 which is FY 2023-24\":**

*   The **methodology** for checking accuracy is the same: compare model predictions against actual behavior in the subsequent N-day window.
*   However, the **actual calendar period** used to determine \"ground truth\" for the `2022-03-31` snapshot is different from the period used for a `2023-03-31` (or `2023-04-30`) snapshot.
    *   For `SnapshotDate = 2022-03-31` (365-day churn), the ground truth is based on activity in **FY22-23** (specifically April 1, 2022 - March 31, 2023).
    *   For `SnapshotDate = 2023-03-31` (365-day churn), the ground truth is based on activity in **FY23-24** (specifically April 1, 2023 - March 31, 2024).

**Is it okay?**

*   **Yes, it's perfectly okay and good practice to validate your model on multiple out-of-time prediction points.** This tests the model's stability and performance across different periods.
*   Using `2022-03-31` as one validation point and `2023-03-31` as another is excellent.
*   Your available raw data (up to `2024-04-30`) allows you to fully determine the ground truth for both of these scenarios, even for the 365-day churn window.

**Summary of Validation Periods for `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`:**

*   **For predictions made on `SnapshotDate = 2022-03-31`:**
    *   Actual churn status determined by activity between `2022-04-01` and `2023-03-31`.
*   **For predictions made on `SnapshotDate = 2023-03-31`:**
    *   Actual churn status determined by activity between `2023-04-01` and `2024-03-31`.

This approach will give you two distinct sets of performance metrics, reflecting how your model would have performed if deployed at those different times. This is much more robust than relying on a single test set."""),

You want to take clients based on their state at `SnapshotDate = 2022-03-31`, make a prediction for them (e.g., will they churn in the next 365 days?), but then validate that prediction against their actual activity in a *much later period*, specifically FY23-24 (April 1, 2023 - March 31, 2024).

Let's analyze this:

**Scenario 3: Prediction for `SnapshotDate = 2022-03-31`, Validation against FY23-24 Activity**

*   **Model Prediction Point:** Model makes predictions for clients based on their state as of `2022-03-31`.
*   **Prediction Target (Example):** Will client churn (no trades AND no logins) in the 365 days *immediately following* `2022-03-31`? (i.e., `2022-04-01` to `2023-03-31`). This is what the `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` label for this snapshot would represent.
*   **Proposed Validation Period:** FY23-24, which is `2023-04-01` to `2024-03-31`.

**Is this a standard or directly interpretable \"accuracy\" check for the model's original prediction?**

**No, not directly for the `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` prediction made *for the period immediately following 2022-03-31*.** Here's why:

1.  **Mismatch of Prediction Window and Validation Window:**
    *   The model, when predicting for `SnapshotDate = 2022-03-31` with a 365-day window, is trying to predict behavior specifically for **April 1, 2022 - March 31, 2023.**
    *   Validating this against activity in **April 1, 2023 - March 31, 2024** (FY23-24) means you are checking behavior in a period that starts a full year *after* the model's intended prediction window ended.

2.  **What would this tell you?**
    *   It would tell you if clients who were predicted to churn (or not churn) based on their `2022-03-31` status *also* happened to be inactive (or active) a full year later during FY23-24.
    *   This is more of a **long-term outcome analysis** or a test of **persistency of status** rather than a direct accuracy measure of the model's prediction for its defined target window.
    *   For example:
        *   A client predicted to churn (i.e., be inactive Apr 2022 - Mar 2023) might indeed have been inactive then. They might *also* have remained inactive through FY23-24. In this case, your new check would \"confirm\" the prediction, but for a different reason/period.
        *   A client predicted to churn (inactive Apr 2022 - Mar 2023) might have been inactive then, but then *reactivated* briefly in early FY23-24 and then gone inactive again, or remained active. Your new check would show them as active/inactive in FY23-24, which doesn't directly validate the original prediction for FY22-23.

**Why this approach is generally NOT used for direct model accuracy:**

*   A model is trained to predict a specific outcome over a specific future timeframe. Its \"accuracy\" is measured against that specific outcome and timeframe.
*   Changing the validation timeframe so drastically disconnects it from what the model was optimized to do.

**What you *could* do if you want to explore this:**

Instead of calling it \"accuracy of the original prediction,\" you could frame it as:

*   \"Of the clients predicted to churn based on their March 2022 status (for the period Apr 2022 - Mar 2023), what percentage of them were *also* found to be inactive during FY23-24?\"
*   \"Of the clients predicted to *not* churn based on their March 2022 status (for the period Apr 2022 - Mar 2023), what percentage of them were found to be active during FY23-24?\"

This is an interesting exploratory analysis of the *longevity* of the predicted churn status, but it's not a direct measure of the model's accuracy for its primary task.

**Recommendation:**

For measuring direct model accuracy, stick to validating the prediction against the actual outcome within the *intended prediction window*.

*   **For `SnapshotDate = 2022-03-31` and a 365-day churn model:** Validate against actual activity from `2022-04-01` to `2023-03-31`.
*   **For `SnapshotDate = 2023-03-31` and a 365-day churn model:** Validate against actual activity from `2023-04-01` to `2024-03-31`.

The analysis you're proposing (March 2022 prediction vs. FY23-24 activity) is a different kind of study, more about the long-term stability of churned/active states. It's valid to explore, but it shouldn't be confused with the primary accuracy assessment of the model for its defined task.

If you want to predict churn for the FY23-24 period *based on FY22-23 data*, you would essentially be building a model with a 2-year prediction window, or a 1-year window with a 1-year lag. That's a different modeling problem."""),

This allows us to establish a baseline and see if more sophisticated models offer significant improvements.

Here are the Machine Learning models we plan to use, primarily from the `pyspark.ml.classification` library:

1.  **Logistic Regression (`pyspark.ml.classification.LogisticRegression`):**
    *   **Why:**
        *   **Good Baseline:** It's a relatively simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient linear model. It provides a solid baseline to compare against.
        *   **Probabilistic Output:** Directly outputs probabilities, which are useful for ranking clients by churn risk and for metrics like AUC-ROC.
        *   **Handles Imbalance (with `weightCol`):** Spark's implementation allows for class weighting, which is important given that churn datasets are often imbalanced.
    *   **Considerations:** Assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds of churn. May not capture complex non-linear interactions.

2.  **Random Forest Classifier (`pyspark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifier`):**
    *   **Why:**
        *   **Non-linearity and Interactions:** It's an ensemble of decision trees and can capture complex non-linear relationships and feature interactions without explicit engineering.
        *   **Robust to Overfitting (generally):** By averaging multiple trees, it's usually more robust to overfitting than a single decision tree.
        *   **Feature Importance:** Provides measures of feature importance, which are valuable for understanding churn drivers.
        *   **Handles Imbalance (with `weightCol`):** Also supports class weighting.
    *   **Considerations:** Can be more computationally intensive to train than Logistic Regression, especially with many trees or deep trees. Less directly interpretable than Logistic Regression (though feature importances help).

3.  **Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT) Classifier (`pyspark.ml.classification.GBTClassifier`):**
    *   **Why:**
        *   **High Performance:** Often one of the best-performing \"off-the-shelf\" algorithms for structured/tabular data. It builds trees sequentially, where each new tree tries to correct the errors of the previous ones.
        *   **Non-linearity and Interactions:** Excellent at capturing these.
        *   **Feature Importance:** Also provides feature importance measures.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   **Prone to Overfitting (if not tuned carefully):** More sensitive to hyperparameters (like `maxDepth`, `learningRate/stepSize`, number of trees/`maxIter`) than Random Forest. Requires careful tuning.
        *   **Computationally Intensive:** Generally the most resource-intensive of the three to train.
        *   **No direct `weightCol` for imbalance in Spark's GBTClassifier:** This is a key difference. To handle imbalance with GBTs in Spark, we'd typically rely on:
            *   **Oversampling/Undersampling:** Applied during the data preprocessing phase *before* GBT training (though our current plan is to use `weightCol` which isn't directly GBT compatible for this).
            *   **Adjusting prediction thresholds:** After getting probabilities, choose a threshold that optimizes for metrics like F1-score or precision/recall on the minority class.
            *   **Custom Loss Functions (Advanced):** Not straightforward in standard Spark ML.

**Modeling Process Steps for each chosen target variable (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`):**

1.  **Prepare Data:**
    *   Select features and the target column.
    *   VectorAssembler: Combine feature columns into a single \"features\" vector.
    *   StandardScaler: Scale the \"features\" vector.
2.  **Train/Test Split:** Time-based split.
3.  **Model Training & Initial Evaluation:**
    *   Train Logistic Regression (with `weightCol` if imbalanced). Evaluate.
    *   Train RandomForestClassifier (with `weightCol`). Evaluate.
    *   Train GBTClassifier. Evaluate (consider adjusting threshold if severely imbalanced and `weightCol` isn't an option).
4.  **Evaluation Metrics:** AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.
5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning (using `CrossValidator` and `ParamGridBuilder`):**
    *   For the models that show promise (likely RandomForest and GBT, potentially Logistic Regression too), perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize their performance.
6.  **Feature Importance Analysis:** For the best performing tuned model(s).
7.  **Iteration:** Repeat for other target variables (`Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`, `_90Days`, `_365Days`).

This progression from simple to more complex models, combined with robust evaluation and tuning, is a standard and effective approach for classification tasks like churn prediction. We will start with Logistic Regression as our first model once the ABT is ready."""),

    *   Condition B (Subsequent Inactivity): Activity (or lack thereof) from `2023-04-01` to `2024-03-31`.
*   **Data Used for Condition B:** Yes, this uses raw data from FY23-24 (specifically Apr 2023 - Mar 2024).
*   **Is this a problem for label creation?** No, this is correct. To know the *actual ground truth* for what happened after `2023-03-31`, you *must* use data from that future period. The churn labels in your ABT are meant to be the \"answers.\"

**Layer 2: Model Training and Prediction (Where the potential issue lies if not careful)**

This is where the \"very high accuracy\" concern comes from if the process isn't set up correctly.

*   **If your model training data *includes information derived from the future period you are trying to predict for*, then yes, you will get artificially high accuracy.** This is data leakage.

**How to Avoid Artificially High Accuracy (Proper Train/Test/Validation Split):**

Let's say you want to validate your model's ability to predict churn for the period starting after `2023-03-31`.

1.  **Define your Validation/Test Set:**
    *   Your validation/test set will consist of client snapshots at `SnapshotDate = 2023-03-31`.
    *   The features for these snapshots are calculated based on data *up to and including* `2023-03-31`.
    *   The **target labels** (`Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays`) for these snapshots are determined by looking at actual behavior *after* `2023-03-31` (as discussed in Layer 1 – this is correct for ground truth).

2.  **Define your Training Set:**
    *   Your training set **MUST** consist of client snapshots *strictly before* your validation/test set's snapshot date.
    *   For example, you could train your model on snapshots from `2021-01-31` up to `2023-02-28` (or even `2022-12-31` to have a gap).
    *   **Crucially:** When the churn labels for these *training* snapshots were created, they were also based on looking into *their respective futures*. For example, for a training snapshot of `2022-06-30`, the `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` label was determined by looking at activity from `2022-07-01` to `2023-06-30`. This is fine.

3.  **Model Training:**
    *   Train your chosen ML model (Logistic Regression, etc.) using only the **training set** (e.g., snapshots up to `2023-02-28`). The model learns patterns from historical features and their corresponding (future-derived) churn outcomes.

4.  **Model Prediction & Accuracy Check (Validation):**
    *   Use the trained model to make predictions on the **validation/test set** (snapshots at `2023-03-31`). The model only sees features available as of `2023-03-31`.
    *   Compare the model's predictions against the *actual ground truth churn labels* for the `2023-03-31` snapshots (which, as we established, were correctly derived using data from FY23-24).

**Why this setup does NOT inherently lead to artificially high accuracy:**

*   **No Future Leakage into Training Features:** The model trained on data up to Feb 2023 has *no knowledge* of the specific outcomes or raw data from Apr 2023 - Mar 2024 when it's making predictions for the Mar 2023 snapshot.
*   **Independent Test:** The validation set (Mar 2023 snapshots) is \"unseen\" by the model during training in terms of its specific feature values *at that point in time* leading to an outcome.
*   **Ground Truth is Sacred:** The fact that the ground truth labels for the Mar 2023 validation set use FY23-24 data is simply what's required to know the *actual* answer. The model isn't \"seeing\" this future raw data during its prediction task for Mar 2023.

**When would you get artificially high accuracy?**

You'd get it if, for example:

*   You accidentally included features in your Mar 2023 validation set that were derived *from* FY23-24 data (e.g., \"number of trades client made in Apr 2023\" as a feature to predict churn starting Apr 2023). This is direct leakage.
*   Your training set somehow overlapped in time with your validation set in a way that the model saw the future outcomes of the validation instances.

**Conclusion:**

Your plan to use raw data from FY23-24 to determine the *actual churn status* (the ground truth labels) for predictions made on `2023-03-31` snapshots is **correct and necessary for a proper validation.**

The key to avoiding artificially high accuracy lies in a **strict temporal separation between your training data and your validation/test data.** The model must be trained on data from a period *before* the period it is being asked to predict for, and the features it uses for prediction must only contain information available up to the prediction point.

As long as your feature engineering for the `2023-03-31` snapshot only uses information from *before or on* `2023-03-31`, and your model is trained on snapshots *before* `2023-03-31`, then comparing its predictions to the true outcomes (derived using FY23-24 data) is a fair and valid assessment. The accuracy you get will be a true reflection of how well your model learned to generalize from the past to predict that specific future period."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""You're asking two excellent, critical questions that get to the heart of practical model deployment and evaluation!

Let's address them one by one.

**Question 1: \"That is why I am asking to calculate accuracy on snapshot 2022-03-31 with raw data of 2023-24 FY.\"**

I understand your intent better now. You're trying to simulate a scenario where there's a significant gap between the prediction point and the observation period for the outcome, perhaps to test robustness over a very long horizon or a delayed assessment.

Let's re-evaluate this specific scenario:

*   **Prediction Point:** Model uses client data as of `2022-03-31` to make a prediction.
*   **What the Model Predicts (Standard):** If it's an `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` model, it's predicting inactivity for the period `2022-04-01` to `2023-03-31`.
*   **Your Proposed \"Accuracy Check\":** Check actual activity (or inactivity) during FY23-24 (`2023-04-01` to `2024-03-31`).

**Why this is still NOT a direct \"accuracy\" measure of the original prediction:**

*   The model wasn't trained to predict inactivity in FY23-24 based on March 2022 data. It was trained to predict inactivity in FY22-23 based on March 2022 data.
*   A client could have been correctly predicted as \"churned\" for FY22-23 (i.e., inactive Apr 2022 - Mar 2023) and then *reactivated* in FY23-24. In your proposed check, this would look like a \"wrong\" prediction, but the model was actually right for its intended target.
*   Conversely, a client correctly predicted as \"not churned\" for FY22-23 (i.e., active Apr 2022 - Mar 2023) might then become inactive in FY23-24. Your proposed check might flag this as a \"wrong\" prediction, but again, the model was right for its target.

**What this analysis *would* measure:**

It measures the **persistence of the (predicted) churn status over an additional year.**
*   \"Of clients predicted to be churned for FY22-23 (based on Mar 2022 data), what percentage were *still* inactive in FY23-24?\"
*   \"Of clients predicted to be active for FY22-23 (based on Mar 2022 data), what percentage were *still* active in FY23-24?\"

This is a valuable analysis for understanding long-term client trajectories and the stability of churn/activity states, but it's different from the model's direct predictive accuracy for its defined task.

**If you truly want to predict inactivity in FY23-24 using data from March 2022, you would need to define your target variable differently:**
`Is_Churned_Engage_FY23_24_From_Mar2022_Snapshot = 1` if client inactive from Apr 2023 - Mar 2024, given their state on Mar 2022. This is a model predicting an outcome that starts 1 year after the snapshot and lasts for 1 year. This is a much harder prediction task.

**Recommendation:** For standard model accuracy, stick to validating against the period the model was designed to predict. For the type of analysis you're proposing, label it clearly as an analysis of \"long-term status persistence\" or \"delayed outcome assessment.\"

---

**Question 2: \"When we seek to put this whole model on live data, we won't have future raw data, so for new clients what will we do?\"**

This is the fundamental nature of predictive modeling in a live environment! You are absolutely right.

Here's the process:

1.  **Model Training (Done on Historical Data):**
    *   Your model is trained using the historical ABT where churn labels (`Is_Churned_Engage_N_Days`) were created using *known future outcomes* from that historical data.
    *   The model learns the patterns: \"Clients with feature set X_historical at Time_T tended to churn (or not churn) N days after Time_T.\"

2.  **Model Deployment (Live System):**
    *   The trained model (e.g., the saved Logistic Regression, RandomForest, or GBT model object) is deployed.

3.  **Making Predictions on Live Data (e.g., for today, let's say it's `2024-06-10`):**
    *   **Snapshot Generation:** For all current active clients (or new clients who have just passed an initial period), you generate their features *as of today* (`2024-06-10`). This involves calculating their recency, frequency, monetary values, etc., based on their activity *up to and including* `2024-06-10`.
    *   **No Future Data Used for Features:** Critically, you only use data available *up to the present moment* to create the features for prediction.
    *   **Feed to Model:** These current feature vectors are fed into your deployed model.
    *   **Model Output:** The model outputs a **probability of churn** for each client for each of the N-day windows it was trained on (e.g., probability of being inactive for the next 60 days, 90 days, etc., starting from `2024-06-11`).
        *   E.g., For Client XYZ, `SnapshotDate = 2024-06-10`:
            *   Predicted P(Churn in next 60 days) = 0.75
            *   Predicted P(Churn in next 365 days) = 0.85

4.  **Actioning Predictions:**
    *   You use these probabilities. You might set a threshold (e.g., if P(Churn) > 0.7, flag for intervention).
    *   Targeted marketing, retention offers, customer service outreach, etc., are initiated based on these predictions.

5.  **No Immediate \"Accuracy Check\" on Live Predictions:**
    *   You are correct. For the prediction made on `2024-06-10` for the next 60 days, you **cannot immediately check its accuracy on `2024-06-10`** because the 60-day outcome period (`2024-06-11` to `2024-08-09`) hasn't happened yet.

6.  **Delayed Performance Monitoring & Retraining (The Feedback Loop):**
    *   **Data Collection:** You continue to collect raw activity data.
    *   **After the Outcome Period:** Once `2024-08-09` has passed, you can now go back and see what *actually* happened to the clients for whom you made predictions on `2024-06-10`.
    *   **Performance Calculation:** You can then calculate the accuracy, precision, recall, etc., of the predictions your model made 60 days prior.
    *   **Model Monitoring:** This ongoing, delayed check is crucial for monitoring model performance over time. If accuracy starts to degrade significantly (a phenomenon called \"model drift\" or \"concept drift\"), it's an indicator that the underlying client behavior patterns may have changed.
    *   **Retraining:** Based on this monitoring, you will periodically **retrain your model** using more recent historical data (including the newly observed outcomes) to ensure it remains accurate and relevant. The retraining frequency depends on how quickly behaviors change and model performance degrades (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annually).

**In summary for live deployment:**

*   The model makes predictions based on *current* data for a *future* outcome.
*   You act on those predictions *before* the future outcome is known.
*   You can only verify the accuracy of those specific live predictions *after* the future period has passed.
*   Confidence in the live model's predictions comes from rigorous backtesting and validation on historical data (like the `2023-03-31` snapshot exercise we discussed). If it performed well historically on out-of-time data, you have a reasonable expectation it will perform well on truly live, unseen data, at least for a while.
*   Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining are essential for maintaining a useful live prediction system.

    I will then update the `load_eom_cash_balance` function and the path in Cell 1 accordingly.

2.  **Delimiter for Deposits/Payouts:**
    *   In the `load_funding_data` function, I've assumed `delimiter=\"~\"` based on some of our earlier discussions about other files from `biuser`. Please confirm if `deposit_data.txt` and `payout_data.txt` actually use `~` or if they use `,` (like `trade_data.txt` and `client_details.txt` now seem to).

Once these details are confirmed for the EOM cash balance file (and deposit/payout delimiters), we can ensure the loading functions are correct, and then proceed to Snapshot Generation and Feature Engineering.

This is the foundational data loading part. The structure is similar to what we've used in exploratory notebooks, just a bit more formalized into functions."""),

The plan has always been to use **PySpark for both data preparation (ABT generation) and for the modeling process.** This ensures consistency, scalability, and allows us to leverage Spark's distributed processing capabilities throughout the entire pipeline.

And **Random Forest** is an excellent choice for one of our primary ML models, as discussed. It's robust, handles non-linearity well, and provides feature importances.

**Confirmation of Our Approach:**

*   **ABT Generation (current focus, `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`):** This entire script will be PySpark-based. We are using PySpark DataFrames, transformations, window functions, joins, etc., to build the features and target labels.
*   **Modeling (`Churn_Modeling.ipynb` - subsequent notebook):** We will use PySpark MLlib (`pyspark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifier`, along with `LogisticRegression` and `GBTClassifier`) for training, tuning, and evaluating the models. The entire modeling pipeline (feature vectorization, scaling, model fitting, evaluation) will be within the PySpark ML framework.

**Regarding Random Forest as a starting point for modeling (after Logistic Regression as a baseline):**
This is a solid choice. Once the ABT is generated by the script we are currently building, the next step in `Churn_Modeling.ipynb` will be:
1.  Load the ABT Parquet file.
2.  Data splitting (time-based).
3.  Feature assembly (`VectorAssembler`) and scaling (`StandardScaler`).
4.  Train a baseline `LogisticRegression` model.
5.  Then, train a `RandomForestClassifier` model.
6.  Evaluate and compare both.
7.  Proceed with hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest (and potentially GBTs later).

So, your preferences are perfectly aligned with the project plan.

**Now, back to the immediate task for `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`:**

Please provide the details for the **EOM Cash Balance Data file** so I can update the `load_eom_cash_balance` function and relevant paths in Cell 1 and Cell 3 of the ABT script:

1.  **Exact Filename:** (e.g., `eom_cash_balances.csv`, `client_cash_eom.txt`)
2.  **Directory Location:** (Is it in `input_tables_dir` or elsewhere?)
3.  **Column Names:** For Client ID, EOM Date, and Cash Balance amount.
4.  **Delimiter:** (e.g., `,`, `~`, `|`)
5.  **Date Format for the EOM Date column:** (e.g., `yyyy-MM-dd`, `dd/MM/yyyy`, `MM-dd-yy`)

And also, please confirm the **delimiter** for `deposit_data.txt` and `payout_data.txt` (is it `~` or `,` or something else?).

Once we have these, we can finalize the data loading part of the ABT script."""),

Let's update the plan and the PySpark code for data loading.

**Confirmations & New Information:**

*   **AUM Data (`AUM.txt`):**
    *   Location: `Tables` folder (same as others).
    *   Columns: `MONTH`, `CLIENTCODE`, `MONTHLYAUM`, `RUNNINGTOTALAUM`.
    *   `MONTH` format: `DD/MM/YYYY` (represents the start of the month).
    *   `MONTHLYAUM`: Sum of `AUM_AH_CUT` for that client in that month.
    *   `RUNNINGTOTALAUM`: Cumulative AUM up to that month for the client.
    *   Delimiter: Appears to be comma (`,`) from the sample.
*   **Cash Balance Data (`CASHBAL.txt`):**
    *   Location: `Tables` folder.
    *   Columns: `CLIENTCODE`, `DDATE`, `CASHBAL`.
    *   `DDATE` format: `DD/MM/YYYY` (represents the end of the month).
    *   `CASHBAL`: Can be positive or negative.
    *   Delimiter: Appears to be comma (`,`) from the sample.
*   **Inclusion of `GrossBrokerage` in ABT:** Yes, this is already part of the plan. The `load_trade_data` function loads `TOTAL_GROSS_BROKERAGE_DAY` as `GrossBrokerage`, and we will sum this over lookback periods to create features like `Gross_Brokerage_Sum_X_D`.
*   **Other Tables' Format:** For now, let's assume the formats for `client_details.txt`, `trade_data.txt`, `deposit_data.txt`, and `payout_data.txt` are as we last corrected/confirmed them. If there are any changes to those, please let me know. The main uncertainty was the delimiter for deposits/payouts.

**Revised Data Loading (Cells 1, 2, 3 of `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`):**

Let's update the placeholder names and the `load_eom_cash_balance` function, and add a new `load_aum_data` function. I'll also update the assumed delimiters based on your samples.

**Action Items for You:**

1.  **Delimiter for Deposits/Payouts:** Please confirm the delimiter for `deposit_data.txt` and `payout_data.txt`. I have left it as `~` in `load_funding_data` but it might be `,` like the others. If it's `,`, I'll change the function.
2.  **Review `trim(col(...))`:** I've added `trim()` around `CLIENTCODE` in most loading functions as a robustness measure, as client codes from text files can sometimes have leading/trailing spaces. This is generally good practice.
3.  **AUM `MONTH` interpretation:**
    *   `AUM.txt` has `MONTH` as `DD/MM/YYYY` representing the start of the month. For linking this to our EOM snapshots, when we want \"AUM for the month of the snapshot\", we'll need to match based on the year and month.
    *   For example, for `SnapshotDate = 2021-01-31`, we'd look for AUM records where `AUMMonthStartDate` is `2021-01-01`.
    *   The `MonthlyAUM` is what we'd likely use as \"AUM for that month\" if we need a monthly value. `RunningTotalAUM` could also be a feature.
4.  **Cash Balance `DDATE`:** This is an EOM date, which aligns perfectly with our EOM snapshots for the payout percentage calculation (using the previous month's EOM cash balance).

Once you confirm the delimiter for deposit/payout files, these first three cells should correctly load all your raw data sources. Then we can proceed to snapshot generation."""),

1.  **Delimiter:** All `.txt` tables use `,` as the delimiter.
2.  **Identifier for Deposits/Payouts:** It's `CLIENTCODE`.
3.  **Date Format for Deposits/Payouts:** `05/08/2020` implies `dd/MM/yyyy`. My `load_funding_data` function currently uses `dd-MMM-yy`. This needs to be changed.

**Summary of Changes in Updated Cell 2:**

*   **`load_client_details`:** Delimiter confirmed as `,`. `CLIENTCODE` is trimmed.
*   **`load_trade_data`:** Delimiter confirmed as `,`. `CLIENTCODE` is trimmed.
*   **`load_login_data`:** Delimiter assumed as `,` for consistency. `ClientCode_raw` is trimmed.
*   **`load_funding_data` (for Deposits & Payouts):**
    *   Delimiter changed to `,`.
    *   Date format for parsing changed to `dd/MM/yyyy`.
    *   Identifier confirmed as `CLIENTCODE` (trimmed).
*   **`load_aum_data`:** Delimiter confirmed as `,`. `CLIENTCODE` is trimmed.
*   **`load_cash_balance_data`:** Delimiter confirmed as `,`. `CLIENTCODE` is trimmed.

With these changes, Cell 1, Cell 2, and Cell 3 of `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` should now accurately reflect the structure of all your input files.

You can now replace the content of Cell 2 in your notebook with the code block above. After that, running Cells 1, 2, and 3 should load all data correctly.

Once you confirm these cells run without error and the sample `show()` outputs look good, we'll proceed to **Cell 4: Snapshot Date Generation**."""),

**Summary of Corrections:**

*   **Cell 3:**
    *   Changed `eom_cash_balance_master_df = load_eom_cash_balance(spark, eom_cash_balance_path)` to `cash_balance_master_df = load_cash_balance_data(spark, cashbal_data_path)`.
    *   Updated `eom_cash_balance_master_df` to `cash_balance_master_df` in the `persisted_dfs` list.

With these changes, the references to the cash balance data path, loading function, and DataFrame variable should now be consistent.

Please replace your Cell 1 and Cell 3 with these corrected versions. Cell 2 (where `load_cash_balance_data` is defined) should already be correct from the previous update. Then try running Cells 1, 2, and 3 again."""),

The error message:
`[UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION] A column or function parameter with name DEPOSITDATE cannot be resolved. Did you mean one of the following? [DEPOSIT_DATE, DEPOSIT_AMOUNT, CLIENTCODE].`

This tells us that in your `deposit_data.txt` file, the actual column name for the deposit date is `DEPOSIT_DATE` (with an underscore), not `DEPOSITDATE` (without an underscore) which I had assumed. Similarly, for the amount, it suggests `DEPOSIT_AMOUNT`.

We need to make these corrections in the call to `load_funding_data` within **Cell 3** for the deposits.

Let's also anticipate a similar potential issue for the `payout_data.txt`. While we don't have an error for it yet, it's good to be mindful. You previously said the identifier is `CLIENTCODE`. We need to ensure the date and amount column names for payouts are also correct. For now, I'll keep the payout ones as `PAYOUTDATE` and `APPROVEDAMOUNT` and we can adjust if an error occurs or if you can provide the exact names for payout columns too.

**Key Changes in Corrected Cell 3:**

1.  **For `deposits_master_df`:**
    *   `date_col_name` changed from `\"DEPOSITDATE\"` to `\"DEPOSIT_DATE\"`.
    *   `amount_col_name` changed from `\"REALIZEDAMOUNT\"` to `\"DEPOSIT_AMOUNT\"` (this is an assumption based on the error message's suggestion pattern for `DEPOSIT_DATE`; **please verify if `DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` is indeed the correct column name for the amount in `deposit_data.txt`**).
2.  **Persisting Logic:** Added a small check (`df_to_persist.head(1)`) before persisting to ensure the DataFrame isn't empty and to trigger any lazy evaluations if an error occurred silently during loading. Also added more informative print statements.
3.  **Sample Data Print:** Made the print statement more descriptive with DataFrame names and added `printSchema()` to help verify loaded columns and types.

**Action Items for You:**

1.  **Verify `DEPOSIT_AMOUNT`:** Is `DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` the correct column name for the deposit value in `deposit_data.txt`?
2.  **Column Names for `payout_data.txt`:** Could you please provide the exact column names for the **payout date** and **payout amount** in your `payout_data.txt` file? This will help us proactively set them correctly in the `load_funding_data` call for payouts.

Please replace your Cell 3 with this corrected version. After verifying the `DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` and providing the payout column names, we can make final adjustments and run the data loading phase again."""),

This clarifies:

1.  **`deposit_data.txt`:**
    *   Date column: `DEPOSIT_DATE`
    *   Amount column: `DEPOSIT_AMOUNT`
2.  **`payout_data.txt`:**
    *   Client ID column: `CLIENTCODE` (with a potential space after it before the comma, so `trim` is important).
    *   Date column: `PAYOUT_DATE`
    *   Amount column: `PAYOUT_AMOUNT`
    *   Date format: `dd/MM/yyyy` (from `05/08/2020`)
    *   Delimiter: `,`

The note about \"space after CLIENTCODE and ,\" is very important. Spark's CSV reader has an option `ignoreLeadingWhiteSpace` and `ignoreTrailingWhiteSpace` which can sometimes help, but applying `trim()` to the `CLIENTCODE` column after loading is generally more robust. Our current `trim(col(\"CLIENTCODE\"))` in the loading functions should handle this.

Let's update **Cell 3** one more time with the correct column names for payouts. Cell 2 (function definitions) should already be correct given the parameterization of `load_funding_data`.

**Explanation and Key Points:**

*   **Cell 4 (Snapshot Generation):**
    *   It now robustly finds the global min/max `ActivityDate` by unioning the `ActivityDate` columns from all relevant activity DataFrames (trades, logins, deposits, payouts). This ensures the `overall_max_date` is accurate.
    *   The `SNAPSHOT_START_DATE_STR` and `MAX_ACTIVITY_LOOKFORWARD_NEEDED` constants (defined in Cell 1) are used to determine the range of snapshot dates.
    *   It generates month-end snapshot dates.
    *   `snapshots_df` is persisted as it will be cross-joined.
*   **Cell 5 (Client-Snapshot Base):**
    *   It uses `client_master_df` (which contains all clients with known activation dates) as the basis for the `client_universe_df`.
    *   Performs a `crossJoin` with `snapshots_df`. `broadcast(snapshots_df)` is used as `snapshots_df` is expected to be much smaller than the client universe, potentially optimizing the join.
    *   **Important Filter:** `filter(col(\"SnapshotDate\") >= col(\"ActivationDate\"))` ensures that we only create client-snapshot rows for periods when the client was actually active (i.e., snapshot is on or after their activation).
    *   **Tenure Calculation:** `Tenure_Days` is calculated immediately as `datediff(col(\"SnapshotDate\"), col(\"ActivationDate\"))`.
    *   `client_snapshot_base_df` is persisted as it will be the foundation for all subsequent feature engineering and joins.

Please run these two cells (Cell 4 and Cell 5).
**Check the output carefully for:**
1.  **Cell 4:**
    *   The `Overall Min/Max Activity Date`.
    *   The `Snapshot Start/End Date for generation`.
    *   The number of snapshot dates generated and a sample.
2.  **Cell 5:**
    *   `Total unique clients from master data`.
    *   `Total client-snapshot records` after the cross-join and filtering. This number can be very large (num_clients * num_snapshots approx), so Spark might take a while.
    *   The sample output, ensuring `SnapshotDate` is always >= `ActivationDate` and `Tenure_Days` looks correct.

Once these are confirmed, we'll be ready to dive into the extensive feature engineering phase."""),

This phase will involve calculating Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM-style) features, Funding Flow features, the new Payout Risk features, and potentially AUM-related features. We'll do this by joining the `client_snapshot_base_df` with the various master activity DataFrames.

Given the number of features, this will span multiple cells. We'll try to group them logically.

**Correction/Refinement in Recency Calculation Logic:**
The initial recency logic was a bit off. A more standard and efficient way in Spark for \"days since last event\" for each snapshot is to join the snapshot table with the event table and then use a window function to find the max event date *before or on* the snapshot date.

**Explanation of Revisions and Cell 7:**

*   **Cell 6 (Recency - Revised):**
    *   The original logic for recency using `row_number()` within a join was inefficient and complex.
    *   The revised `calculate_recency_feature` function uses a more standard approach:
        1.  Left join the `base_df` (client-snapshots) with the `activity_df`.
        2.  The join condition is `activity_date <= snapshot_date`.
        3.  Then, `groupBy(ClientCode, SnapshotDate)` and `agg(pyspark_max(activity_date))` to find the latest activity date on or before the snapshot.
        4.  This `Last_Activity_Date` is joined back, and `datediff` calculates the recency.
    *   This is generally more performant and idiomatic for Spark.
*   **Cell 7 (Frequency and Monetary):**
    *   A helper function `calculate_lookback_features` is created.
    *   For each `SnapshotDate` and `ClientCode`, and for each lookback period (`days`):
        *   It joins with the relevant activity DataFrame (`trades_master_df`, `logins_master_df`, etc.).
        *   The join condition filters activities that fall within the lookback window: `ActivityDate <= SnapshotDate` AND `ActivityDate > SnapshotDate - days`.
        *   `countDistinct(ActivityDate)` gives the number of unique days the client was active (e.g., `Trade_Days_Count_X_D`).
        *   `pyspark_count(ActivityDate)` gives the total number of transactions/events (e.g., `Trade_Txns_Count_X_D`).
        *   `pyspark_sum(value_col)` (if applicable) gives the monetary sum (e.g., `Trade_Sum_X_D` which is brokerage, `Deposit_Sum_X_D`).
        *   Results are left-joined back, and nulls (for clients with no activity in that window) are filled with 0.
    *   This function is called for trades, logins, deposits, and payouts.

**Before Running Cell 6 and 7:**

*   Ensure Cells 1-5 have completed successfully and `client_snapshot_base_df` is created and persisted.
*   These cells (especially Cell 7) will perform multiple joins and aggregations, so they can be computationally intensive. Monitor Spark UI if possible.

Please run Cell 6 first. Check its sample output for recency features. If it looks good, then run Cell 7. This separation helps debug if one part is slow or problematic."""),

This is a classic Spark error. It means your Spark application (specifically the driver or executors) ran out of memory while trying to process the data, most likely during a large join or shuffle operation within the `calculate_lookback_features` function, specifically when it got to processing Deposits.

The `calculate_lookback_features` function performs a join between `snaps_for_lookback` (derived from `abt_df`) and the respective `activity_df` (like `deposits_master_df`) for *each* lookback period. If `abt_df` is very large (millions of client-snapshot rows) and `deposits_master_df` is also large, these repeated joins can consume a lot of memory, especially if there's data skew or inefficient partitioning.

**Strategies to Address `OutOfMemoryError`:**

1.  **Increase Spark Driver/Executor Memory (If possible in your environment):**
    *   If you are running this in an environment where you can configure Spark (like a local Spark setup, a Databricks cluster, or a cloud EMR/Dataproc cluster), you can increase `spark.driver.memory` and `spark.executor.memory`.
    *   In Google Colab, direct control over this is limited, but sometimes a higher RAM runtime helps.

2.  **Optimize the `calculate_lookback_features` Function:**
    The current approach joins the full `snaps_for_lookback` with the activity data for each `days` in `lookback_days_list`. This is a lot of repeated work on the `snaps_for_lookback` side.

    **Alternative Approach: Pre-aggregate Activities by Date, then Join once**
    Instead of joining `snaps_for_lookback` to the raw activity data multiple times, we can try to optimize by relating activities to snapshots differently. However, lookback calculations are inherently tricky with joins.

    **Let's refine the join strategy within `calculate_lookback_features` and ensure proper unpersisting.**

    **One key issue could be the iterative growth of `current_abt_features_df` inside the loop if it's not being handled carefully.** We are joining `freq_df` and `monetary_df` back to `current_abt_features_df` in each iteration of the `lookback_days_list`. This `current_abt_features_df` grows wider.

    **A more robust approach for the loop is to collect all new feature DataFrames and join them all at once at the end of the loop for a given `feature_name_prefix`.**

    Let's try to optimize `calculate_lookback_features` by:
    *   Ensuring `snaps_for_lookback` is not repeatedly joined in a way that causes lineage explosion.
    *   Making sure we are not carrying over too much state in `current_abt_features_df` through the loop in a problematic way.
    *   Using `broadcast` hints more strategically if some DataFrames are consistently smaller.

**Revised `calculate_lookback_features` function in Cell 7:**

**Key Changes in the Revised `calculate_lookback_features` and its usage:**

1.  **Single Join and Aggregation per `days`:** Inside the loop for `lookback_days_list`, it performs only *one* join between `client_snapshots_ref_df` and `activity_df_aliased`. Then, it calculates all aggregations (counts, sum) in a single `.agg()` call. This is much more efficient.
2.  **Building Features Incrementally for Each Activity Type:**
    *   The helper function now calculates *all* lookback features (for all `days` in the list) for *one* activity type (e.g., Trades) and stores them in `features_for_this_activity_type_df`.
    *   This intermediate DataFrame (containing only keys and the new features for that activity type) is then joined back to the main `base_abt_df`.
3.  **Managing `abt_df` Reference:**
    *   The main `abt_df` is passed to the function. The function returns a *new* DataFrame with the added features.
    *   The returned DataFrame is then reassigned to `current_abt_df_ref`.
    *   **Strategic Persist/Unpersist:** After each major block of features (e.g., all Trade lookbacks) is added, the intermediate `current_abt_df_ref` is persisted. This breaks the lineage and can help Spark manage memory better. It's then unpersisted before the next block so the variable can be reassigned. The *final* `abt_df` after all lookbacks are added is persisted.

**Other Potential Optimizations (If OOM still occurs):**

*   **Reduce `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` (or increase if too low):** The default of 200 might be too high or too low depending on your cluster size and data. For Colab, sometimes a lower number like 50 or 100 can paradoxically help if memory is very constrained, or a higher number if you have more cores available but not enough parallelism. This is experimental.
*   **Salting for Skewed Joins:** If the OOM is due to data skew on `ClientCode` during joins, salting could help, but it's more complex to implement.
*   **Checkpointing:** `df.checkpoint()` is more robust than `persist()` as it writes to disk and truncates lineage, but it's slower. Can be used for very large, critical intermediate DFs.
*   **Iterative Processing:** If memory is extremely tight, you might have to process `client_snapshot_base_df` in batches, but this significantly complicates the logic.

**Try this revised Cell 7.** The structural change to how features are aggregated and joined back should be more memory-efficient. The persist/unpersist strategy within the main loop should also help."""),

Okay, the OOM error has shifted. It's now occurring when trying to `.persist()` the `current_abt_df_ref` *after* the Deposit lookback features have been calculated and joined.

This means the DataFrame `current_abt_df_ref` at that point has become too large to fit into the available memory for caching, even with the revised `calculate_lookback_features` function. The DataFrame is growing wider with each call to the helper function, and by the time Deposit features are added, it's exceeding capacity.

**Reasons for OOM during `persist()`:**

1.  **Wide DataFrame:** Each call to `calculate_lookback_features` adds `len(LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS) * 2` (for counts) or `* 3` (for counts + sum) columns. After Trades, Logins, and Deposits, the ABT is becoming very wide.
    *   Trades: 5 lookbacks * 3 cols/lookback = 15 new cols
    *   Logins: 5 lookbacks * 2 cols/lookback = 10 new cols
    *   Deposits: 5 lookbacks * 3 cols/lookback = 15 new cols
    *   Total new columns before Payouts: 40 columns.
    *   If the base ABT had ~5-10 columns, we are now at ~45-50 columns. For 10 million rows, this is substantial.
2.  **Complex Lineage (even with `persist`):** While `persist` helps, if the plan to compute the DataFrame is still very complex, materializing it can be costly.
3.  **Data Skew:** If some `ClientCode` or `SnapshotDate` combinations result in disproportionately large intermediate data during the joins within `calculate_lookback_features`, this can strain memory.
4.  **Colab Memory Limits:** Google Colab has finite RAM, and we might be hitting its practical limits for a DataFrame of this size and width, especially when `persist()` tries to hold it in memory.

**Strategies to Mitigate This (Focusing on Colab's Limitations):**

Since we can't easily increase Spark memory in Colab beyond choosing a high-RAM runtime, we need to make the process \"lighter.\"

1.  **Reduce the Number of Concurrent Features Being Calculated or Persisted:**
    *   Instead of persisting the *entire growing* `current_abt_df_ref` after each major block, we could calculate features for each activity type (Trades, Logins, Deposits, Payouts) *independently* based on the `client_snapshot_base_df` (which only has keys and tenure), save these feature blocks to temporary Parquet files, and then join them all at the end. This avoids carrying a progressively wider DataFrame in memory.

2.  **Checkpointing Instead of Persisting (More Aggressive Memory Saving):**
    *   `df.checkpoint()` writes the DataFrame to a reliable distributed file system (like HDFS, or a local path that Spark can use) and truncates the logical plan. This is much more effective at breaking lineage and reducing memory pressure than `persist()`, but it's slower due to disk I/O. In Colab, the checkpoint directory needs to be set up.

3.  **Process Fewer Lookback Periods at Once (If Necessary):**
    *   If the issue is purely the width from too many lookback columns, we could reduce `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` temporarily for debugging or split the feature generation even further. (Less ideal as we want all features).

4.  **Reduce `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` for Colab:**
    *   Sometimes, for single-node execution like Colab, a very high number of shuffle partitions (default 200) can create too much overhead for small tasks or fragment memory. Reducing it (e.g., to a number closer to available cores, like 4, 8, or even 1 if it's really struggling) can *sometimes* help, but it can also make large shuffles slower. This is experimental.
    *   You can set this in Cell 1: `.config(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", \"50\")` (try a value like 50).

**Let's try Strategy 1: Calculate Feature Blocks Independently and Join at the End.**

This is a significant refactoring of Cell 7 but is the most likely to succeed in a memory-constrained environment like Colab.

**Key Changes in this \"Independent Blocks\" Strategy:**

1.  **`base_keys_df`:** We create a `base_keys_df` containing just `ClientCode` and `SnapshotDate` from the current `abt_df` (which has recency features). This small DataFrame is persisted and used as the left side for calculating each feature block.
2.  **`calculate_feature_block` Modification:**
    *   The helper function now takes `client_snaps_keys_df` as input.
    *   It builds a DataFrame (`current_block_features_df`) that *only* contains the keys (`ClientCode_key`, `SnapshotDate_key`) and the newly generated lookback features for *that specific activity type* (e.g., all trade lookbacks).
    *   It returns this relatively narrow DataFrame.
3.  **Main Loop:**
    *   The main part of Cell 7 now calls `calculate_feature_block` for Trades, Logins, Deposits, and Payouts *sequentially*.
    *   Each returned block (e.g., `trade_features_block_df`) is persisted. This is important because these blocks are now smaller and self-contained.
    *   After all individual feature blocks are calculated and persisted, they are *all joined back* to the `final_abt_df` (which started as the `abt_df` with recency features).
    *   The intermediate blocks are unpersisted after being joined.
4.  **Memory Management:**
    *   This approach avoids growing one massive DataFrame (like `current_abt_df_ref` in the previous attempt) wider and wider with each iteration.
    *   Persisting the smaller, independent feature blocks should be more manageable.
    *   The final set of joins might still be heavy, but the components being joined are well-defined.

**Before Running:**

*   It might be beneficial to restart your Colab kernel to ensure a clean memory state before running this significantly refactored Cell 7.
*   Ensure Cell 6 (Recency) has completed successfully and `abt_df` (with recency features) is available and persisted. The code unpersists it before starting the lookback calculations.

This strategy has a better chance of completing without OOM in Colab. It trades off some repeated work on `base_keys_df` for better memory control by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable persisted chunks."""),

This usually happens for one of these reasons:

1.  **Cell 6 (Recency Features) Was Not Run or Did Not Complete Successfully:**
    *   The `abt_df` is created and persisted at the end of Cell 6. If Cell 6 encountered an error, or if you didn't run it in the current session before running Cell 7, then `abt_df` wouldn't be defined or wouldn't be cached.
2.  **Kernel Restart:** If the Colab kernel was restarted between running Cell 6 and Cell 7, all in-memory variables and cached DataFrames (like `abt_df`) would be lost.
3.  **`abt_df.unpersist()` Called Prematurely or Incorrectly:** If `abt_df.unpersist()` was called after Cell 6 but before Cell 7 without a re-persist, it wouldn't be cached. (Our current logic in Cell 6 *does* persist it at the end).
4.  **Issue with `is_cached`:** Though less likely, there could be a subtle issue where `is_cached` doesn't reflect the true state if the `persist()` call itself had an issue (e.g., OOM during persist, though the error usually appears on an action).

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Re-run Cell 6:**
    *   Go back to Cell 6 (the \"Revised Cell 6: Recency Features\" that uses the `calculate_recency_feature` helper function).
    *   Run it completely.
    *   **Carefully check its output.** Ensure it prints:
        *   \"Recency features calculated. Sample:\"
        *   A sample of the DataFrame.
        *   The final line: `print(f\"ABT DF Count after Recency: {abt_df.count()}\")` along with a count.
        *   No errors during its execution.
    *   The `abt_df.persist()` at the end of Cell 6 is critical.

2.  **Verify `abt_df` After Running Cell 6:**
    *   After Cell 6 completes successfully, you can add a temporary new cell immediately after it and run:
        ```python
        if 'abt_df' in locals():
            print(f\"abt_df exists. Is cached: {abt_df.is_cached}\")
            abt_df.printSchema()
            print(f\"Count: {abt_df.count()}\") # This action will confirm if persist was effective
        else:
            print(\"abt_df does not exist.\")
        ```
    *   This will tell you if `abt_df` is indeed defined and if Spark considers it cached. The `.count()` action will force materialization if it wasn't fully cached.

3.  **Run Cell 7 Again:**
    *   Once you've confirmed Cell 6 ran correctly and `abt_df` is properly persisted, then try running the (latest revised) Cell 7 again.

**Why the unpersisting in Cell 7 is there:**
The line `if abt_df.is_cached: print(\"Unpersisting abt_df from recency step...\"); abt_df.unpersist()` at the beginning of the `calculate_each_block` section in Cell 7 is intentional *if* we were going to reassign `abt_df` *inside* that section.

However, with the \"Independent Blocks\" strategy, the `abt_df` from Cell 6 (which contains client-snapshot-base + tenure + recency) is used as the starting point (`final_abt_df = abt_df`), and the new feature blocks are joined to it. So, it *should* be cached when Cell 7 starts.

The most likely scenario is that Cell 6 didn't fully complete or persist `abt_df` correctly before you attempted to run Cell 7. Please try re-running Cell 6 carefully and then the verification steps above."""),

In the **Revised Cell 6 (Recency Features)**, I introduced a helper function `calculate_recency_feature`. Inside that function, the line:
`snaps_distinct_df = base_df.select(\"ClientCode\", \"SnapshotDate\").distinct()`

And then later:
`recency_calc_df = snaps_distinct_df.alias(\"s\") \\ ... .groupBy(col(\"s.ClientCode\"), col(\"s.SnapshotDate\")) \\ ...`

The `groupBy` should ideally be on the original column names from `base_df` before the alias if `snaps_distinct_df` is an intermediate step for clarity. More directly, the `groupBy` in the aggregation should use the aliased columns if the join is built upon them.

Let's ensure the PySpark DataFrame API is used correctly and consistently. The core logic of joining and then grouping to find the max date is sound, but the column referencing within the helper function needs to be perfectly clean.

**Key Changes in this \"Corrected Revised Cell 6\":**

1.  **Helper Function `calculate_single_recency_feature`:**
    *   This function is now designed to calculate recency for *one activity type* at a time.
    *   It takes `main_abt_df` (the evolving ABT) and the specific `activity_df` (e.g., `trades_master_df`).
    *   It explicitly aliases the `activity_df` inside the join using `activity_df_alias_str`.
    *   The join condition `(col(f\"abt.ClientCode\") == col(f\"{activity_df_alias_str}.{activity_pk_col}\")) & ...` uses qualified column names after aliasing `main_abt_df` to \"abt\" and `activity_df` to its alias.
    *   The `groupBy` uses the qualified columns from the \"abt\" alias.
    *   The `agg` calculates `pyspark_max` of the qualified activity date column.
    *   The result (`last_activity_dates`) is then joined back to the `main_abt_df` using the standard \"ClientCode\" and \"SnapshotDate\" keys.
    *   This structure is more explicit and less prone to ambiguity.
2.  **Iterative Application:**
    *   `abt_df_recency_build` (which starts as `client_snapshot_base_df`) is passed to the helper function for each activity type. The result updates `abt_df_recency_build`.
    *   After all recency features are added, `abt_df_recency_build` is assigned back to `abt_df` and then persisted.
3.  **Column Selection for `show()`:** Added a check to ensure only existing columns are selected for the sample display, which is more robust if a feature inadvertently doesn't get created.

This version of Cell 6 should be more robust in its PySpark usage for calculating recency.

**Before Running:**
Ensure `client_snapshot_base_df` from Cell 5 is correctly created and persisted. Then, try running this corrected Cell 6.

If this cell runs successfully and the recency features look correct, the `abt_df` will be defined and cached, and then Cell 7 (Frequency/Monetary features, using the \"Independent Blocks\" strategy) should be able to pick it up correctly."""),

The \"Independent Blocks\" strategy for Cell 7 was already designed to be more robust by separating the calculation of each feature block (Trades, Logins, etc.) and using `base_keys_df`. However, we can double-check the internal logic of `calculate_feature_block` to ensure maximum clarity and correct PySpark usage, especially around the `join` and `groupBy` operations.

Let's review and refine the `calculate_feature_block` function within **Cell 7**.

**Key Refinements in this version of Cell 7:**

1.  **Explicit Aliasing in `calculate_feature_block`:**
    *   `keys_df_input` (which is `base_keys_df`) is aliased to `s_keys`.
    *   `activity_df_input` is aliased to `activity_alias_str` (e.g., \"t\", \"l\", \"d\", \"p\").
    *   All column references within the join (`keys_df.join(activity_df_aliased, ...)`), `groupBy`, and `agg` use these aliases (e.g., `col(\"s_keys.ClientCode\")`, `col(f\"{activity_alias_str}.ActivityDate\")`). This makes ownership explicit.
2.  **Key Renaming for Clarity:**
    *   The keys in `current_block_features_df` are `ClientCode_block_key`, `SnapshotDate_block_key`.
    *   The keys from the `aggregated_lookback_df` are `ClientCode_agg_key`, `SnapshotDate_agg_key`.
    *   This avoids any ambiguity when joining `aggregated_lookback_df` to `current_block_features_df`.
    *   Before returning, `current_block_features_df` renames its keys back to `ClientCode` and `SnapshotDate` for the final join to the main `abt_df`.
3.  **Robust `fillna`:** The `fillna(0)` is applied to the specific columns added in each iteration for each lookback period *within* `calculate_feature_block`. An additional safety `fillna(0)` is added after joining each block to `final_abt_with_lookbacks_df`, targeting the newly introduced feature columns from that block.
4.  **Persisting Strategy:**
    *   `base_keys_df` (ClientCode, SnapshotDate from the ABT after recency) is persisted once.
    *   Each feature block (`trade_features_block_df`, etc.) is persisted after it's fully calculated.
    *   The main `abt_df` (initially with recency features) is joined with these blocks one by one.
    *   The final, fully featured `abt_df` is persisted at the very end of this cell. Intermediate blocks are unpersisted after joining.
5.  **Parameter Naming:** Updated some parameter names in the helper for better clarity (e.g., `activity_pk_col`, `activity_date_col_in_activity_df`).

This refined version of Cell 7 should be more robust against ambiguous column errors and manage memory more effectively by breaking down the wide feature generation.

**Important:**
*   Ensure Cell 6 (Recency Features) has run successfully and `abt_df` is defined and cached from that step. The code in Cell 7 now explicitly unpersists this `abt_df` at the beginning of the \"Calculate each feature block\" section because `final_abt_with_lookbacks_df` starts as a copy of it and then gets rebuilt.
*   This cell will still be computationally intensive.

Assuming Cell 7 (Frequency and Monetary Features) has now run successfully and `abt_df` (containing client-snapshot base, tenure, recency, frequency, and monetary features) is persisted, we can move on to the next blocks of feature engineering.

Next up:
1.  **Funding Flow Features** (derived from existing deposit/payout sums).
2.  **AUM Features** (if we decide to use `MonthlyAUM` or `RunningTotalAUM` as features).
3.  **Payout Risk Features** (using `CASHBAL.txt`).
4.  **Delta Features** (change in key metrics over time - this one is more complex and can be memory intensive, so we'll approach it carefully).

**Explanation of Cells 8 & 9:**

*   **Cell 8 (Funding Flow & AUM):**
    *   **Funding Flow:** Calculates `Net_Funding_Flow_X_D` and `Payout_To_Deposit_Ratio_X_D` using the sum columns (e.g., `Deposit_Sum_X_D`, `Payout_Sum_X_D`) that were created in Cell 7. Handles division by zero for the ratio.
    *   **AUM Features:**
        *   It creates a `SnapshotYearMonth` (e.g., \"2021-01\") from `SnapshotDate` and an `AUMYearMonth` from `AUMMonthStartDate`.
        *   Joins `abt_df` with `aum_master_df` on `ClientCode` and this common `YearMonth` string.
        *   This brings in `AUM_SnapshotMonth_Monthly` (the AUM for the specific month of the snapshot) and `AUM_SnapshotMonth_RunningTotal` (cumulative AUM up to that month).
        *   Fills nulls for AUM features with 0.0 (you might reconsider this if `null` has a different meaning, e.g., client not in AUM system vs. zero AUM).
*   **Cell 9 (Payout Risk Features):**
    *   **Total Payouts in Snapshot Month:** Calculates the sum of `ApprovedAmount` from `payouts_master_df` for each client-snapshot, considering payouts within the month of the `SnapshotDate`.
    *   **Cash Balance from Previous EOM:** Calculates `PreviousMonthEOM` (last day of the month prior to `SnapshotDate`) and joins with `cash_balance_master_df` to get `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth`.
    *   **Percentage Calculation:** Divides `Total_Payout_In_Snapshot_Month` by `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth`. Handles division by zero (and the case where balance is zero but payout occurs, flagging it as very high risk `99999.0`).
    *   **Risk Flag:** Sets `Payout_Risk_Flag` to \"CHURNRISK\" if the percentage is > 70.
    *   `abt_df` is persisted after these features are added.

**Important Notes Before Running:**

*   **Cell 7 Completion:** Ensure Cell 7 (Frequency/Monetary features) has fully completed and `abt_df` is correctly persisted from that step.
*   **Memory:** These cells also involve joins and new column creations. Monitor memory if possible. The `persist()` calls at the end of each cell are designed to help manage the computation graph for the next stage.
*   **Null Handling for AUM/Cash Balance:** The `fillna(0.0)` for AUM and the `otherwise(None)` for `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance` (when previous month balance is null) are default choices. You might have specific business rules for how to treat missing AUM or cash balance data (e.g., impute with a different value, or create a separate flag for \"AUM_data_missing\"). For now, 0 for AUM and null for the percentage (if balance is unknown) is a reasonable start.

**The Strategy: Iterative ABT Building with Intermediate Disk Saves**

Instead of trying to hold an ever-growing `abt_df` in memory using `.persist()`, we will:

1.  Start with the `client_snapshot_base_df`.
2.  Calculate a block of features (e.g., Recency).
3.  Join these features to the current ABT.
4.  **Write the current state of the ABT to a temporary Parquet file on disk (Google Drive).**
5.  For the next block of features (e.g., Frequency/Monetary):
    *   **Read the ABT from the temporary Parquet file.**
    *   Calculate the new block of features.
    *   Join them.
    *   **Overwrite the temporary Parquet file with the updated ABT.**
6.  Repeat this process for all feature blocks.
7.  The final temporary Parquet file becomes your complete ABT.

**Advantages:**

*   **Reduced Memory Pressure:** Spark doesn't need to keep the entire lineage and data for the growing ABT in memory across many complex transformations. By writing to disk, the lineage is effectively truncated at that point for the next read.
*   **Fault Tolerance (to some extent):** If a later step fails, you have an intermediate ABT saved, so you don't have to restart from the very beginning.
*   **Clearer Stages:** It makes the process more modular.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Slower Execution:** Disk I/O (reading and writing Parquet files) is significantly slower than in-memory operations with `.persist()`. The overall script will take longer to run.
*   **More Disk Space:** You'll need space on Google Drive for these intermediate (and then final) Parquet files.
*   **Code Complexity:** The code becomes slightly more complex with read/write operations in each step.

**Is it okay?**
**Yes, it's a very good and practical approach for your situation to prioritize successful completion over raw speed, especially given the OOM errors.**

Let's outline how we would modify the cells. We'll need a temporary path for these intermediate writes.

**Revised Structure with Intermediate Writes:**

We'll define a temporary ABT path.

```python
# In Cell 1 (Setup)
temp_abt_path = os.path.join(output_abt_dir, \"temp_abt_in_progress.parquet\")
print(f\"Temporary ABT Path for intermediate saves: {temp_abt_path}\")
```

Now, let's modify the feature engineering cells:

    client_snapshot_base_df.persist() # Persist before writing is good practice
    print(f\"Total client-snapshot records (after filtering pre-activation and adding tenure): {client_snapshot_base_df.count()}\")
    print(\"Sample of client_snapshot_base_df:\")

**How this pattern continues for subsequent cells (Cell 8 - Funding Flow/AUM, Cell 9 - Payout Risk, etc.):**

Each subsequent feature engineering cell will:
1.  Start by reading `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(temp_abt_path)`.
2.  Perform its specific feature calculations, adding new columns to this `abt_df`.
3.  At the end of the cell, write the updated `abt_df` back to `temp_abt_path` using `mode(\"overwrite\")`.
    ```python
    # At the end of Cell 8, Cell 9, etc.
    print(f\"Writing ABT with [New Features] to: {temp_abt_path}\")
    abt_df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(temp_abt_path)
    print(\"ABT with [New Features] written successfully.\")
    ```

**Final ABT Save (Last Cell of Feature Engineering/Label Generation):**
After all features AND churn labels are generated, the *final* write operation will save to the *actual* ABT path:
`output_path_parquet = os.path.join(output_abt_dir, f\"{output_file_name_base}.parquet\")`
Instead of `temp_abt_path`.

This iterative read-process-overwrite strategy for `temp_abt_path` will significantly reduce the chances of OOM errors by not requiring Spark to maintain an enormous, ever-expanding execution plan in memory.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Please replace your Cell 5, Cell 6, and Cell 7 with these new versions.
2.  Run them sequentially. Cell 5 will write the initial base. Cell 6 will read it, add recency, and overwrite. Cell 7 will read that, add freq/monetary, and overwrite again.
3.  This will take longer, but hopefully, it will complete without memory errors. Monitor the print statements to see progress.

If these complete successfully, we will apply the same read-process-write pattern to Cells 8 (Funding Flow/AUM) and 9 (Payout Risk), then Delta Features, Churn Label Generation, final filtering, and the final save."""),

**Key Changes for this Iterative Strategy:**

*   Each \"feature group\" cell (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) now starts by `spark.read.parquet(temp_abt_path)` (except Cell 5 which creates the initial one).
*   After adding its features, it `abt_df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(temp_abt_path)`.
*   `persist()` is used before writing and actions like `count()` to materialize the current state, then `unpersist()` can be called after writing if that `abt_df` variable is immediately reassigned by reading from disk in the next cell. However, since each cell now *reads* the `abt_df` fresh, the main `abt_df` variable within the cell will hold the latest state. The `persist()` calls before write are mainly to optimize the write step itself after transformations. The unpersisting of `abt_df` at the end of each cell is to free up memory before the next cell reads it again.

This makes the process more robust to memory limits. Run them sequentially."""),

Spark's `DataFrameWriter` (`df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(path)`) will typically handle directory creation:

*   **If the final directory in the path does not exist, Spark will create it.**
    For example, if `temp_abt_path` is `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/temp_abt_in_progress.parquet`:
    *   If `output_abt_final_pred` exists but `temp_abt_in_progress.parquet` (which is a directory for Parquet) does not, Spark will create `temp_abt_in_progress.parquet`.
    *   If `output_abt_final_pred` also does not exist, Spark will attempt to create it as well.

*   **`mode(\"overwrite\")`:** If the `temp_abt_in_progress.parquet` directory *does* exist, `overwrite` mode will delete its contents (and the directory itself) and then recreate it with the new data.

**However, there's a small nuance with Google Drive via Colab:**

While Spark usually creates directories, sometimes Google Drive File Stream (GDFS) used by Colab can have slight delays or quirks with rapid creation/deletion, or if parent directories are missing far up the chain.

**The code I added in Cell 1 already includes a check for the *parent directory* of the *final* ABT:**
```python
# In Cell 1 (Setup)
output_abt_dir = os.path.join(google_drive_base_path, 'Tables/output_abt_final_pred/')
temp_abt_path = os.path.join(output_abt_dir, \"temp_abt_in_progress.parquet\") # temp_abt_path is INSIDE output_abt_dir

# Ensure the output directory exists (this covers the parent of temp_abt_path)
if not os.path.exists(output_abt_dir): # Checks if /content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/ exists
    try:
        os.makedirs(output_abt_dir) # Creates it if it doesn't
        print(f\"Created directory: {output_abt_dir}\")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f\"Could not create directory {output_abt_dir}: {e}\")
```

This code snippet ensures that the directory `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/` exists. Since `temp_abt_path` is *inside* this directory, Spark should then have no trouble creating the `temp_abt_in_progress.parquet` directory itself during the first write.

**So, in summary:**

*   You generally **don't** need to manually create `temp_abt_in_progress.parquet`.
*   The existing code in Cell 1 to create `output_abt_dir` (which is the parent of `temp_abt_path`) should be sufficient to allow Spark to write the temporary Parquet files successfully.

You can proceed with running the cells. The first time Cell 5 (or any cell that writes to `temp_abt_path`) runs, it should create the necessary directory structure."""),

**Here's how it works for resuming:**

1.  **Intermediate State Saved to Disk:** Each time a cell like Cell 6, 7, 8, or 9 successfully completes and writes to `temp_abt_path` using `abt_df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(temp_abt_path)`, the current state of your ABT (with all features added up to that point) is saved persistently on your Google Drive.

2.  **Closing the Session:** When you close your Colab session (or if it times out, or the kernel crashes after a successful write to `temp_abt_path`), the in-memory Spark DataFrames are lost, but the Parquet file on your Drive remains.

3.  **Resuming Work:**
    *   When you open the notebook again and want to continue:
        *   **Run Cell 1 (Setup):** This re-initializes Spark, mounts your Drive, and defines all paths, including `temp_abt_path`.
        *   **Run Cell 2 (Data Loading Functions):** This defines the helper functions.
        *   **Run Cell 3 (Load All Raw Data):** This reloads all the *master* data DataFrames (trades, logins, client master, etc.) and persists them. This is necessary because the subsequent feature engineering cells will need these master DataFrames for joins.
        *   **Skip to the Next Uncompleted Feature Cell:** If you successfully completed up to Cell 9 (Payout Risk features) and it wrote to `temp_abt_path`, you don't need to re-run Cells 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. You can directly proceed to Cell 10 (Delta Features, if that's next) or Cell 11 (Churn Label Generation).
        *   The first thing Cell 10 (or whichever cell is next) will do is `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(temp_abt_path)`. This will load the ABT in the state it was in when Cell 9 finished writing it.

**Example:**

*   You run Cells 1-9. Cell 9 completes and writes the ABT (with base + recency + freq/monetary + funding/AUM + payout risk features) to `temp_abt_path`.
*   You close the session.
*   Later, you come back.
*   You run Cell 1 (Setup).
*   You run Cell 2 (Define loading functions).
*   You run Cell 3 (Load and persist `trades_master_df`, `logins_master_df`, etc.).
*   You can then **skip directly to Cell 10 (Delta Features)**. Cell 10 will start by reading the `temp_abt_path`, which contains the output of Cell 9.

**Important Considerations for Resuming:**

*   **Master DataFrames:** You *must* re-run Cell 3 to load and persist the master DataFrames (`trades_master_df`, `logins_master_df`, etc.) because these are not part of the `temp_abt_path` (which only stores the evolving ABT itself). The feature engineering cells (like Delta features, or even re-running an earlier one if needed) will perform joins against these master DataFrames.
*   **Constants/Variables from Earlier Cells:** If later cells depend on variables defined in earlier \"setup\" cells (like `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` from Cell 1, or `snapshots_df` from Cell 4 if it were needed directly later), those cells also need to be re-run. Our current structure mostly relies on reading the intermediate ABT and the master data.
*   **Cell Execution Order:** Always ensure you're running cells in a logical order. If you modify an earlier cell (e.g., change a loading function), you'd need to re-run from that point to propagate changes.

So, yes, this iterative disk-writing approach provides a good way to save progress and resume, making it much more practical for long-running, multi-stage data processing tasks in environments like Colab. The \"temporary\" path is temporary in terms of the ABT's evolution, but the data stored there is persistent on your Drive."""),

**Note on Delta Calculation:** The delta logic above compares the metric at `SnapshotDate` (which reflects the past 90 days up to `SnapshotDate`) with the metric at `SnapshotDate - 1 month` (which reflects the 90 days up to `SnapshotDate - 1 month`). This gives a month-over-month change in the 90-day rolling metric. If you want deltas between strictly non-overlapping periods, the feature engineering for the \"previous period value\" would be more complex (e.g., needing sums/counts for days -180 to -91). For now, this provides a reasonable \"trend\" indicator.

**Explanation of Cells 10, 11, 12:**

*   **Cell 10 (Delta Features):**
    *   Reads the ABT from `temp_abt_path`.
    *   Defines a `delta_configs` list specifying which existing features (e.g., `Trade_Days_Count_90D`) to calculate deltas for.
    *   Uses a `Window` function with `lag(col(base_col), 1)` to get the value of the feature from the previous snapshot (assuming monthly snapshots).
    *   Calculates the delta (current - previous). Fills null deltas with 0.0 (e.g., for the first snapshot of a client).
    *   Writes the updated ABT back to `temp_abt_path`.
*   **Cell 11 (Churn Label Generation):**
    *   Reads ABT from `temp_abt_path`.
    *   Iterates through `CHURN_WINDOWS_DAYS`.
    *   **Condition A (Recent Engagement):** Checks if `Trade_Days_Count_{n_days}D > 0` OR `Login_Days_Count_{n_days}D > 0`. These \"lookback\" count columns must match the `n_days` of the churn window. *(Self-correction: My previous `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` might not perfectly align with all `CHURN_WINDOWS_DAYS`. The code now explicitly uses `n_days` from `CHURN_WINDOWS_DAYS` for the lookback column names, assuming such columns like `Trade_Days_Count_60D` were created in Cell 7. If not, this part of Condition A needs adjustment or prior creation of those specific lookback counts.)*
    *   **Condition B (Subsequent Inactivity):** Joins with `trades_master_df` and `logins_master_df` to count distinct trade/login days in the `n_days` *after* `SnapshotDate`.
    *   Sets the churn label `Is_Churned_Engage_{n_days}Days` to 1 if both A and B are true, else 0.
    *   Writes updated ABT to `temp_abt_path`.
*   **Cell 12 (Finalizing & Saving):**
    *   Reads ABT from `temp_abt_path`.
    *   **Filtering:** Applies a filter (e.g., `Tenure_Days >= 90`).
    *   **`fillna` Strategy:**
        *   `Days_Since_Last_...`: Fills nulls with `Tenure_Days + 1` (or 9999 if tenure is null). This signifies \"never happened or happened before activation, and long ago relative to tenure.\"
        *   Other numeric features (counts, sums, AUM, percentages): Filled with `0.0`.
        *   `Payout_Risk_Flag`: Filled with `\"UNKNOWN_RISK\"` (or similar neutral category).
        *   Target (churn label) columns are cast to Integer.
    *   Prints schema and sample.
    *   **Final Save:** Writes the fully processed DataFrame to the **final `output_path_parquet`** (not `temp_abt_path`) using `mode(\"overwrite\")`.
    *   Unpersists master DataFrames and stops Spark.

**Important Consideration for Cell 11 (Condition A):**
The current logic for Condition A assumes that if you're calculating `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`, you have pre-calculated features like `Trade_Days_Count_60D` and `Login_Days_Count_60D` in Cell 7.
Your `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` is `[30, 90, 180, 270, 365]`.
Your `CHURN_WINDOWS_DAYS` is `[60, 90, 270, 365]`.
This means for the 60-day churn window, we don't have an exact `_60D` lookback count from Cell 7.
We need to decide:
1.  Either add `60` to `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` in Cell 1 and ensure Cell 7 calculates these. (Recommended for consistency).
2.  Or, for the 60-day churn's Condition A, use the closest available lookback, e.g., `Trade_Days_Count_30D` or `Trade_Days_Count_90D`. (Less ideal, as the definition specifies \"XXX days before\").

I would recommend **Option 1: Add 60 to `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` in Cell 1.**
So, in Cell 1:
`LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS = [30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 365]`
This will ensure Cell 7 generates `_60D` lookback counts, which Cell 11 can then use for `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`.

Assuming you make that change in Cell 1, the rest of the code should align. Run these cells sequentially. Good luck! This is the home stretch for ABT generation."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""You are absolutely right to be cautious about re-running Cell 7 if it took 4 hours!

If Cell 7 (Frequency and Monetary features) has already completed successfully and its output (the ABT with those features) has been written to `temp_abt_path`, then:

**You DO NOT need to re-run Cell 7 just because you change `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` in Cell 1 for the purpose of Cell 11 (Churn Label Generation).**

Here's the plan and reasoning:

1.  **Understanding the Dependency:**
    *   Cell 11 (Churn Label Generation) for `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` needs features like `Trade_Days_Count_60D` and `Login_Days_Count_60D` for its \"Condition A\" (recent engagement).
    *   Cell 7 is where these lookback count features are generated based on `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS`.
    *   If Cell 7 ran with `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS = [30, 90, 180, 270, 365]`, then `Trade_Days_Count_60D` and `Login_Days_Count_60D` were **NOT** created.

2.  **Modifying Cell 1:**
    *   Yes, you should still modify Cell 1 to include 60 in `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS`:
        ```python
        # In Cell 1
        LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS = [30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 365]
        ```
    *   **Re-run Cell 1.** This makes the constant available for *future* runs or if other cells might reference it, but it doesn't retroactively change what Cell 7 already did and wrote to disk.

3.  **Addressing the Missing 60D Lookback Features for Cell 11:**
    Since `Trade_Days_Count_60D` and `Login_Days_Count_60D` are missing from the ABT currently in `temp_abt_path` (because Cell 7 didn't generate them), we have a few options for Cell 11's Condition A for the 60-day churn label:

    *   **Option A (Proxy with Existing Features - Preferred to avoid re-running Cell 7):**
        Modify Cell 11 to use the closest available lookback period for Condition A when `n_days == 60`. For example, use the 30-day lookbacks or the 90-day lookbacks.
        *   Using 30-day lookback: `Trade_Days_Count_30D > 0 OR Login_Days_Count_30D > 0`. This is a slightly stricter Condition A (requires more recent activity).
        *   Using 90-day lookback: `Trade_Days_Count_90D > 0 OR Login_Days_Count_90D > 0`. This is a slightly looser Condition A.
        Choose one and document it. Let's say we use the 90-day lookback as it's closer and ensures we capture anyone active within the last 90 days.

    *   **Option B (Calculate Only the Missing 60D Lookbacks):**
        Create a small, separate cell *before* Cell 11 that *only* calculates `Trade_Days_Count_60D` and `Login_Days_Count_60D` by reading the current `temp_abt_path`, calculating these two specific sets of features (using a simplified version of `calculate_feature_block` just for days=60), and then writing back to `temp_abt_path`. This is more targeted but adds a new cell.

    *   **Option C (Re-run Cell 7 - What we want to avoid):** Not an option right now.

**Let's go with Option A (Proxy with Existing Features) as it's the least disruptive.** We'll use the 90-day lookback features for Condition A of the 60-day churn label. This is a reasonable compromise.

**Summary of Changes in Modified Cell 11:**

1.  **Proxy for 60-Day Condition A:**
    *   `lookback_period_for_cond_A = n_days_churn_window` (default)
    *   `if n_days_churn_window == 60: lookback_period_for_cond_A = 90`
    *   This sets the lookback period for Condition A to 90 days when calculating the 60-day churn label. For all other churn windows (90, 270, 365), it uses their own `n_days_churn_window` as the lookback period (assuming `Trade_Days_Count_90D`, `_270D`, `_365D` etc. were created by Cell 7).
2.  **Temporary Column Names for Flags:**
    *   Inside the loop, Condition A and B flags, and future day counts are named generically (e.g., `Condition_A_Flag`, `Future_Trade_Days_Temp`) so they are overwritten in each iteration of the `n_days_churn_window` loop and correctly dropped. This avoids schema conflicts if we were trying to create columns like `Condition_A_60D`, `Condition_A_90D` etc. on `abt_df` directly within the loop before the final assignment. The `current_abt_with_cond_A` and `current_abt_with_cond_B` ensure we are building upon the correct base for each N-day calculation before updating the main `abt_df`.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Modify and Re-run Cell 1:** Change `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` to `[30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 365]`. This change is for *future completeness* if you ever re-run the whole pipeline, or for any other parts of the script that might use this constant. **It will not affect the `temp_abt_path` file that Cell 7 already wrote.**
2.  **Do NOT Re-run Cell 7.**
3.  **Run Cell 8, 9, 10** sequentially, ensuring each completes and writes to `temp_abt_path`.
4.  **Run the Modified Cell 11** (provided above). This version will use the 90-day lookback features as a proxy for Condition A for the 60-day churn window.
5.  Then proceed to Cell 12 (Finalizing & Saving).

This approach respects your need to avoid re-running Cell 7 while still allowing us to generate all four churn labels with a reasonable approximation for the 60-day window's Condition A."""),

            parts=[
                types.Part.from_text(text="""You are absolutely right to double-check this, and your observation is correct!

The output of Cell 7 that you've shared clearly shows it calculated lookback features for `[30, 90, 180, 270, 365]` because that's what `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` was set to when Cell 7 *actually ran*.

**What this means:**

*   The ABT currently saved in `temp_abt_path` **DOES NOT** have columns like `Trade_Days_Count_60D` or `Login_Days_Count_60D`.
*   Changing `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` in Cell 1 to `[30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 365]` **now** and re-running Cell 1 **will NOT magically add these 60-day lookback columns to the Parquet file that Cell 7 already wrote to disk.**

**Therefore, the strategy in the \"Modified Cell 11\" I provided (using a proxy for the 60D Condition A) is indeed the correct and necessary approach if you do not want to re-run Cell 7.**

Let's re-confirm the logic for Cell 11 to be absolutely sure:

**In the \"Modified Cell 11 (Churn Label Generation)\":**

```python
    # ... (initial part of cell 11) ...

    # CHURN_WINDOWS_DAYS is [60, 90, 270, 365] from Cell 1
    # The ABT from temp_abt_path has lookback features for [30, 90, 180, 270, 365]

    for n_days_churn_window in CHURN_WINDOWS_DAYS: 
        print(f\"  Generating churn label for {n_days_churn_window}-day window...\")
        
        # --- Condition A: Recent Engagement (Lookback) ---
        lookback_period_for_cond_A = n_days_churn_window # Default: try to match churn window
        
        if n_days_churn_window == 60:
            # Since Trade_Days_Count_60D etc. were NOT generated by the previous run of Cell 7,
            # we MUST use a proxy from available columns.
            # Let's use 90D lookback. This means for a 60-day churn,
            # Condition A is: \"Was active (trade OR login) in the 90 days before snapshot.\"
            lookback_period_for_cond_A = 90 
            print(f\"    For {n_days_churn_window}D churn, using {lookback_period_for_cond_A}D lookback features for Condition A (as 60D features are not available in current ABT).\")
        
        lookback_trade_col_A = f\"Trade_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"
        lookback_login_col_A = f\"Login_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"
        churn_label_col = f\"Is_Churned_Engage_{n_days_churn_window}Days\"

        # This check will now correctly use, e.g., \"Trade_Days_Count_90D\" when n_days_churn_window is 60
        if lookback_trade_col_A not in abt_df.columns or lookback_login_col_A not in abt_df.columns:
            print(f\"    ERROR: Lookback columns {lookback_trade_col_A} or {lookback_login_col_A} are unexpectedly missing from ABT. Skipping label for {n_days_churn_window}D churn.\")
            abt_df = abt_df.withColumn(churn_label_col, lit(0).cast(IntegerType())) 
            continue
        
        # ... (rest of Condition A and Condition B logic, and label creation as before) ...
```

**Is just changing in Cell 1 ok?**

*   **For the *current run* (without re-running Cell 7):**
    *   Changing `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` in Cell 1 to include `60` **will have NO EFFECT on the features available for Cell 11 to use from `temp_abt_path`**. Cell 11 will still only find the features that Cell 7 generated based on the *old* `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` setting.
    *   Therefore, the \"proxy logic\" within Cell 11 (using 90D lookback for 60D churn's Condition A) is **essential**.
*   **For *future full re-runs* of the entire notebook:**
    *   Yes, changing `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` in Cell 1 to `[30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 365]` is the correct thing to do. If you ever decide to re-run the *entire pipeline from Cell 1 through Cell 7*, then Cell 7 *would* generate the `_60D` lookback features.
    *   If Cell 7 did generate `_60D` features in such a future run, then the `if n_days_churn_window == 60:` block in Cell 11 could potentially be removed or adjusted, as the direct `_60D` lookback columns would then exist.

**So, for your immediate next steps (running Cell 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 without re-running Cell 7):**

1.  You can optionally update Cell 1 to have `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS = [30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 365]` and re-run Cell 1. This is good for future-proofing but won't change the immediate outcome for Cell 11.
2.  The \"Modified Cell 11\" (which includes the logic to use 90D lookback for 60D churn's Condition A) is the correct version to use. It correctly adapts to the features that are *actually present* in the ABT file written by your previous 4-hour run of Cell 7.

You are right to be precise about what features are available. The proxy logic in Cell 11 is designed to handle exactly this situation where re-running a heavy upstream cell is not feasible."""),

`WARNING: Lookback columns Trade_Days_Count_60D or Login_Days_Count_60D not found for Condition A of 60-day churn. Skipping this label.`

This happened despite our attempt to use a proxy. Let's look at the logic in the \"Modified Cell 11\" again for Condition A for the 60-day churn window.

The relevant part was:
```python
        # --- Condition A: Recent Engagement (Lookback) ---
        lookback_period_for_cond_A = n_days_churn_window # Default: try to match churn window
        
        if n_days_churn_window == 60:
            lookback_period_for_cond_A = 90 # Use 90D as proxy
            print(f\"    For {n_days_churn_window}D churn, using {lookback_period_for_cond_A}D lookback features for Condition A (as 60D features are not available in current ABT).\")
        
        # These column names are now constructed using lookback_period_for_cond_A
        lookback_trade_col_A = f\"Trade_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"
        lookback_login_col_A = f\"Login_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"
        # ...
        if lookback_trade_col_A not in abt_df.columns or lookback_login_col_A not in abt_df.columns:
            print(f\"    ERROR: Lookback columns {lookback_trade_col_A} or {lookback_login_col_A} are unexpectedly missing ...\")
            # ... skipping logic ...
```

When `n_days_churn_window` is `60`:
1.  `lookback_period_for_cond_A` becomes `90`.
2.  `lookback_trade_col_A` becomes `\"Trade_Days_Count_90D\"`.
3.  `lookback_login_col_A` becomes `\"Login_Days_Count_90D\"`.

The warning message `WARNING: Lookback columns Trade_Days_Count_60D or Login_Days_Count_60D not found...` indicates that the `if` condition checking for column existence (`if lookback_trade_col_A not in abt_df.columns ...`) is being evaluated with the *original* `n_days_churn_window` (i.e., 60) to construct the column names for the error message, even if `lookback_trade_col_A` and `lookback_login_col_A` were correctly set to the `_90D` versions for the actual check.

This is likely just an issue with the **print statement formatting** within the warning, not necessarily the core logic for selecting the proxy columns.

However, the fact that it printed the warning and then \"Skipping this label\" means the `if lookback_trade_col_A not in abt_df.columns or lookback_login_col_A not in abt_df.columns:` condition evaluated to TRUE.

This implies that **`Trade_Days_Count_90D` or `Login_Days_Count_90D` (or both) are NOT present in the `abt_df` that was read from `temp_abt_path`**.

**This is unexpected if Cell 7 (Frequency/Monetary) completed successfully and generated these `_90D` columns.**

**Possible Reasons & Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Cell 7 Did Not Actually Create/Save `_90D` Columns:**
    *   Could there have been an issue in Cell 7's logic specifically for the 90-day lookback that caused these columns not to be created or to be dropped before saving?
    *   Go back to the output of Cell 7. Does the sample output show `Trade_Days_Count_90D` (or similar, like `Trade_Days_Count_30D` and `Deposit_Sum_90D` which *are* in your sample)?
    *   Does the final list of columns printed by Cell 7 include `Trade_Days_Count_90D` and `Login_Days_Count_90D`?

2.  **Typo in Column Names:**
    *   Is there a subtle typo in `Trade_Days_Count_90D` or `Login_Days_Count_90D` either in how they were created in Cell 7 or how they are being referenced in Cell 11? (The construction `f\"Trade_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"` seems robust).

3.  **Issue with `temp_abt_path`:**
    *   Is it possible that Cell 11 read an older or incorrect version of `temp_abt_path` that didn't have the output from the successful 4-hour run of Cell 7? (Less likely if you're running sequentially and `overwrite` mode is used).

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Verify Columns in `temp_abt_path` (CRITICAL):**
    *   Insert a new temporary cell *immediately before* your current Cell 11 (or at the very beginning of Cell 11, before the loop).
    *   In this new cell, load the Parquet file and print its schema:
        ```python
        print(\"--- Verifying columns in temp_abt_path before Churn Label Generation ---\")
        temp_abt_check_df = spark.read.parquet(temp_abt_path)
        temp_abt_check_df.printSchema()
        print(f\"Columns found: {temp_abt_check_df.columns}\")
        # Check for specific 90D columns
        for col_name_to_check in [\"Trade_Days_Count_90D\", \"Login_Days_Count_90D\"]:
            if col_name_to_check in temp_abt_check_df.columns:
                print(f\"Column '{col_name_to_check}' IS PRESENT.\")
            else:
                print(f\"COLUMN '{col_name_to_check}' IS MISSING!\")
        del temp_abt_check_df # Clean up
        ```
    *   Run this verification cell. This will tell us definitively if `Trade_Days_Count_90D` and `Login_Days_Count_90D` exist in the file Cell 11 is about to process.

2.  **If the 90D columns are MISSING from `temp_abt_path`:**
    *   This means Cell 7 did not successfully write them. You would, unfortunately, need to revisit Cell 7.
    *   Before re-running Cell 7, double-check its logic for the 90-day calculations and the final select/write to ensure these columns are included. Perhaps a `fillna` or a join dropped them unintentionally.
    *   This would be a setback, but necessary if the input data for Cell 11 is incomplete.

3.  **If the 90D columns ARE PRESENT in `temp_abt_path`:**
    *   Then the issue is more subtle, possibly within the conditional logic or scope inside Cell 11's loop, or a typo I might have introduced in the variable names.
    *   The `print` statement in the warning message in Cell 11 should be fixed to accurately reflect the columns it's actually checking.

        To:
        `print(f\"    WARNING: Lookback columns {lookback_trade_col_A} or {lookback_login_col_A} not found ...\")`

Let's start with Step 1 (Verify Columns). This will guide our next actions. The fact that it proceeded to generate labels for 90D, 270D, and 365D suggests that `Trade_Days_Count_90D`, `Login_Days_Count_90D` (and the 270D, 365D equivalents) *do* likely exist, and the issue might be localized to how the 60D case's proxy columns are checked or if the warning message itself is misleading.

The critical part is the `if lookback_trade_col_A not in abt_df.columns or lookback_login_col_A not in abt_df.columns:` condition. If `Trade_Days_Count_90D` is indeed missing, then \"Skipping this label\" is the correct behavior given the current code.

Using the 30-day lookback period features (like `Trade_Days_Count_30D` and `Login_Days_Count_30D`) as the proxy for Condition A when calculating `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` is a perfectly valid approach, especially since your Cell 7 output confirms these `_30D` columns were indeed generated and are available.

**Rationale for using 30-day lookback for 60-day churn Condition A:**

*   **Availability:** The `_30D` features exist in your current `temp_abt_path`.
*   **Stricter Recent Engagement:** Condition A is \"client had (Trade\\_Days\\_Count\\_XXXD > 0 OR Login\\_Days\\_Count\\_XXXD > 0) in the XXX days *before* the snapshot.\"
    *   If we use `XXX = 30` for the 60-day churn window, it means we are looking for clients who were active (trade or login) in the 30 days immediately preceding the snapshot.
    *   This is a slightly stricter definition of \"recently active\" compared to using a 90-day lookback for Condition A. It might result in a slightly smaller pool of clients satisfying Condition A, but those who do are more demonstrably recently engaged.
*   **Logical Coherence:** While the ideal is for the Condition A lookback period (XXX) to match the churn window (N), using a shorter, available lookback is a reasonable adaptation.

Let's modify Cell 11 to use the 30-day lookback features for Condition A of the 60-day churn label.

**Key Changes in this version of Cell 11:**

1.  **Proxy for 60D Condition A Changed to 30D:**
    *   `if n_days_churn_window == 60: lookback_period_for_cond_A = 30`
    *   The print statement now correctly reflects this.
2.  **Using `current_iter_df` for Intermediate Steps:**
    *   Inside the loop, `current_iter_df = abt_df.withColumn(...)` is used to create the `Temp_Condition_A_Flag`.
    *   The joins for Condition B are done using `current_iter_df.alias(\"abt_iter\")`.
    *   This ensures that the main `abt_df` is only updated *once* per `n_days_churn_window` at the end with the final churn label, and the temporary flag columns (`Temp_Condition_A_Flag`, `Temp_Condition_B_Flag`, `Temp_Future_Trade_Days`, `Temp_Future_Login_Days`) are correctly scoped and dropped for each iteration, preventing them from accumulating or causing schema issues in subsequent iterations of the loop.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Cell 1 Modification (Optional but Recommended for Future):**
    *   You can still update `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS = [30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 365]` in Cell 1 and re-run Cell 1. This won't affect the currently saved `temp_abt_path` but makes your constants complete.
2.  **Run Cells 8, 9, 10** if you haven't already, ensuring `temp_abt_path` is up-to-date after Cell 10 (Delta Features).
3.  **Run this newly Modified Cell 11.**
    *   It should now correctly find `Trade_Days_Count_30D` and `Login_Days_Count_30D` when `n_days_churn_window` is 60, and thus proceed to calculate the `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` label without the \"Skipping this label\" warning for that specific window.
4.  Then, proceed to Cell 12 (Finalizing & Saving).

This adjustment should get Cell 11 working correctly with the available features."""),

Indeed:
*   `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` = `[30, 90, 180, 270, 365]` (as run by Cell 7)
*   `CHURN_WINDOWS_DAYS` = `[60, 90, 270, 365]`

**Your Point:** For `Is_Churned_Engage_N_Days` where `N` is `90, 270, 365`, the lookback features for Condition A (e.g., `Trade_Days_Count_90D`, `Trade_Days_Count_270D`, `Trade_Days_Count_365D`) already exist directly from Cell 7's output.

The only mismatch was for `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` where we didn't have a `_60D` lookback feature.

**Using 30-Day Lookback for 60-Day Churn Window (Condition A):**

The previous modification to Cell 11 correctly addresses this by using the `_30D` lookback features for Condition A of the `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` label. This is a pragmatic solution.

**The question \"90, 180, 270 and 360 (close to 365) all are multiples of 30. so we can use them in this way.\" seems to be exploring if there's a more systematic way to link these or if the current approach is fine.**

**Current Approach in Modified Cell 11:**

```python
        lookback_period_for_cond_A = n_days_churn_window # Default for 90, 270, 365
        
        if n_days_churn_window == 60:
            lookback_period_for_cond_A = 30 # Specific proxy for 60D
        
        lookback_trade_col_A = f\"Trade_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"
        lookback_login_col_A = f\"Login_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"
```

This logic is sound:
*   For `n_days_churn_window = 60`, it uses `_30D` features for Condition A.
*   For `n_days_churn_window = 90`, it uses `_90D` features for Condition A.
*   For `n_days_churn_window = 270`, it uses `_270D` features for Condition A.
*   For `n_days_churn_window = 365`, it uses `_365D` features for Condition A.

This directly uses the features that Cell 7 created. The \"multiples of 30\" observation is interesting from a data granularity perspective, but it doesn't necessitate a change in the current Cell 11 logic *if the goal is simply to use the available pre-calculated lookback features*.

**Alternative Interpretations of your thought (and why the current way is okay):**

*   **Were you thinking of *constructing* N-day lookback features from 30-day blocks?**
    *   For example, to get a `Trade_Days_Count_60D`, one *could* try to combine two distinct 30-day counts. However, this is complex (handling overlaps, distinct days) and less direct than calculating it properly over a 60-day window. Cell 7's method of direct calculation for each specified lookback is better. Since Cell 7 didn't do it for 60D, using the 30D proxy is simpler than trying to reconstruct a 60D count on the fly in Cell 11.

*   **Were you thinking if the 30D features are sufficient for *all* Condition A calculations?**
    *   While you *could* use `_30D` features for Condition A of *all* churn windows (e.g., for 365-day churn, Condition A would be \"active in last 30 days\"), this would make Condition A very strict for longer churn windows. The current approach of matching (or closely proxying) the Condition A lookback period to the churn window length (`n_days_churn_window`) is more aligned with the churn definition's intent: \"was the client engaged *in a period comparable to the churn window we are predicting for*, before they became inactive?\"

**Conclusion:**

The \"Modified Cell 11\" (which uses `_30D` features for the 60D churn's Condition A, and directly matching `_XD` features for X=90, 270, 365) is the correct and most straightforward way to proceed *given the features currently available in your `temp_abt_path` from the previous run of Cell 7*.

Your observation about multiples of 30 is mathematically true but doesn't require a change in the current Cell 11 logic unless you wanted to redefine Condition A significantly (e.g., always use a fixed 30-day lookback for Condition A irrespective of the churn window N – which is not the current plan).

**Therefore, you can proceed with running the \"Modified Cell 11\" as provided in my previous response.** It correctly handles the available features.

If you were to re-run the *entire pipeline from scratch* including Cell 7, then ensuring `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` in Cell 1 includes `60` would allow Cell 7 to generate `_60D` features, and then Cell 11 could use `lookback_period_for_cond_A = n_days_churn_window` without the special `if n_days_churn_window == 60:` case. But for now, the proxy is the way to go."""),

            parts=[
                types.Part.from_text(text="""This output from your verification step is PERFECT and very informative!

**Key Confirmations:**

1.  **Schema is Rich:** The `printSchema()` output shows that the ABT in `temp_abt_path` (which is the result after Cell 10 - Delta Features) contains a comprehensive set of features:
    *   Base info: `ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate`, `ActivationDate`, `Tenure_Days`
    *   Recency features: `Last_Trade_Date`, `Days_Since_Last_Trade`, etc. (for Trade, Login, Deposit, Payout)
    *   Frequency & Monetary (Lookback) Features: `_Days_Count_XD`, `_Txns_Count_XD`, `_Sum_XD` for Trade, Login, Deposit, Payout across all defined lookback periods (30, 90, 180, 270, 365 days).
    *   Funding Flow Features: `Net_Funding_Flow_XD`, `Payout_To_Deposit_Ratio_XD`.
    *   AUM Features: `AUM_SnapshotMonth_Monthly`, `AUM_SnapshotMonth_RunningTotal`.
    *   Payout Risk Features: `Total_Payout_In_Snapshot_Month`, `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth`, `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`, `Payout_Risk_Flag`.
    *   Delta Features: `Trade_Days_90D_Delta`, `Login_Days_90D_Delta`, `Brokerage_Sum_90D_Delta`.

2.  **Crucial Columns for 60D Churn Proxy ARE PRESENT:**
    *   `Column 'Trade_Days_Count_90D' IS PRESENT.`
    *   `Column 'Login_Days_Count_90D' IS PRESENT.`
    *   The output from Cell 7 you shared also shows `Trade_Days_Count_30D` and `Login_Days_Count_30D` are present.

**This means the \"Modified Cell 11\" (which uses the 30-day lookback features as a proxy for Condition A of the 60-day churn label) should now work correctly without triggering the \"ERROR: Lookback columns ... missing\" for the 60D case.**

The previous warning message in Cell 11's output:
`WARNING: Lookback columns Trade_Days_Count_60D or Login_Days_Count_60D not found for Condition A of 60-day churn. Skipping this label.`
was likely due to one of two things:

*   A subtle bug in how the `lookback_trade_col_A` and `lookback_login_col_A` variables were being checked *within the specific context of the `n_days_churn_window == 60` block* in the version of Cell 11 that produced that warning.
*   Or the error message *itself* was hardcoded to print `_60D` even if it was checking for `_30D` or `_90D` columns (which is why I suggested correcting the print statement in the \"Modified Cell 11\").

**The \"Modified Cell 11\" I provided most recently (the one that explicitly sets `lookback_period_for_cond_A = 30` when `n_days_churn_window == 60`) should now function correctly because:**
1.  It will correctly construct `lookback_trade_col_A` as `\"Trade_Days_Count_30D\"` and `lookback_login_col_A` as `\"Login_Days_Count_30D\"` for the 60-day churn window.
2.  Your verification output confirms that `Trade_Days_Count_30D` and `Login_Days_Count_30D` **DO EXIST** in the `abt_df` that Cell 11 will read from `temp_abt_path`.
3.  Therefore, the `if lookback_trade_col_A not in abt_df.columns or lookback_login_col_A not in abt_df.columns:` check should evaluate to `False` for the 60D case, and it will proceed to calculate the `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days` label.

**You are clear to proceed with running the \"Modified Cell 11\" (the one that uses `lookback_period_for_cond_A = 30` for the 60D churn window) and then Cell 12.**

This careful verification step was very important! It gives us high confidence that the necessary input columns for the churn label generation are indeed present."""),

Okay, we've hit the `OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` again, this time in Cell 11 (Churn Label Generation), specifically when an action (`.count()`) is called after the loop that generates the churn labels.

The print statements indicate it successfully started generating labels for all windows:
`Generating churn label for 60-day window... For 60D churn, using 30D lookback features for Condition A.`
`Generating churn label for 90-day window...`
`Generating churn label for 270-day window...`
`Generating churn label for 365-day window...`

This means the error occurred either during the calculation for the 365-day window (which involves the largest `date_add`) or when trying to materialize the full `abt_df` (with all churn labels added) for the `.persist()` and `.count()` operations.

The `abt_df` is growing wider with each iteration of the `n_days_churn_window` loop, as new churn label columns are added. The joins performed inside the loop to calculate future activity (Condition B) are also intensive.

**Strategies to Address OOM in Cell 11:**

1.  **Iterative Write for Churn Labels Too (Similar to Feature Blocks):**
    Instead of adding all four churn label columns to the `abt_df` in memory and then persisting/counting, we can calculate and add *one churn label at a time*, write the ABT with that label to `temp_abt_path`, then read it back to add the next label. This is the most robust way to manage memory if the DataFrame becomes too wide or the lineage too complex.

2.  **Optimize Joins for Condition B:**
    *   The joins `abt_df_with_cond_A.alias(\"abt\").join(...)` are performed for *every* N-day window. If `abt_df_with_cond_A` is large, these are repeated heavy operations.
    *   We could pre-aggregate the *raw* future activities first, relative to *all possible start dates*, and then join those pre-aggregates. This is much more complex. The current approach is more straightforward but can be heavy.

3.  **`repartition()` before heavy joins/aggregations:**
    *   Sometimes, if data skew is an issue, repartitioning `abt_df` or the activity DFs by `ClientCode` before the joins *within* the loop might help distribute the load better. However, repartitioning is also a shuffle and has its own cost.
    *   `abt_df = abt_df.repartition(spark.sparkContext.defaultParallelism, \"ClientCode\")`

4.  **Reduce `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`:**
    *   If Spark is trying to broadcast a DataFrame that's too large, it can cause OOM. We are not explicitly broadcasting in the churn label part, but Spark might do it automatically. Setting this threshold lower (e.g., to -1 to disable auto-broadcasting, or a smaller byte size) can force Spark to use sort-merge joins, which are generally more robust for large DFs but can be slower. This is usually a last resort.
    *   Add to SparkSession config in Cell 1: `.config(\"spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold\", \"-1\")`

**Let's try Strategy 1: Iterative Write for Churn Labels.**
This mirrors the successful approach for the feature blocks and is most likely to work in Colab.

**Key Changes in this Iterative Cell 11:**

1.  **Read/Write Inside Loop:**
    *   At the beginning of *each iteration* of the `n_days_churn_window` loop, `abt_df_iter = spark.read.parquet(current_abt_file_path)` loads the ABT.
    *   After the specific churn label (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`) is calculated and added to `abt_df_iter`, it's written back: `abt_df_iter.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(current_abt_file_path)`.
2.  **`current_abt_file_path`:** This variable (which is just `temp_abt_path`) is used for clarity that we are re-reading and overwriting the same temporary file.
3.  **`iter_calc_df`:** Calculations for Condition A and B for the *current* N-day window are done on a temporary DataFrame `iter_calc_df` derived from `abt_df_iter`. This keeps the logic clean for each iteration.
4.  **Persist/Unpersist within Loop:** `abt_df_iter.persist()` is called before the write to optimize the write operation, and then `unpersist()` after the write to free memory for the next iteration's read.
5.  **Error Handling for Missing Lookback Columns:** The `continue` statement ensures that if, for some reason, the required lookback columns for Condition A are missing for a particular `n_days_churn_window`, it adds a default churn label (0) and writes the DataFrame before moving to the next `n_days_churn_window`. This makes it more robust.

**Before Running This Revised Cell 11:**

*   Ensure Cell 10 (Delta Features) ran successfully and wrote its output to `temp_abt_path`.
*   Ensure the master DataFrames (`trades_master_df`, `logins_master_df`) are still persisted from Cell 3. If your kernel restarted, you **must re-run Cells 1, 2, and 3** to load and persist these master DataFrames.
*   This iterative approach will be slower due to repeated disk I/O, but it's much more likely to complete without OOM errors.

This should significantly improve memory stability for the churn label generation."""),

This error is different from the `OutOfMemoryError`. It indicates that your PySpark driver (running in your Colab Python kernel) is trying to connect to a component of the Spark cluster (even if it's a local \"cluster\" running on the same Colab instance) and that component is not responding or not available.

This typically happens in Colab if:

1.  **The SparkSession (or its underlying components) has crashed or been terminated silently.**
    *   This could be a delayed consequence of previous memory pressure, even if a prior cell didn't explicitly show an OOM for *itself*. The Spark context might have become unstable.
    *   Sometimes Colab itself might terminate backend processes if they consume too many resources over time.

2.  **Network Issues within the Colab Environment:** Less common for this specific error in a standard Colab setup, but theoretically possible.

**The error occurred when the code tried to perform an action that requires communication with the Spark backend, likely the `abt_df_iter.count()` call inside the loop, or even the `spark.read.parquet()` at the beginning of the loop if the Spark context was already dead.**

The traceback points to `py4j.clientserver.py` in `connect_to_java_server`, which is the bridge between Python and the Spark JVM.

**Recommended Steps to Resolve:**

1.  **Restart the Colab Runtime/Kernel:** This is the most common and often effective solution for this type of error in Colab.
    *   Go to \"Runtime\" in the Colab menu.
    *   Select \"Restart runtime...\" (or \"Restart session...\" depending on the UI).
    *   Confirm the restart.
    *   **This will clear all variables and cached DataFrames in memory.**

2.  **Re-run Necessary Cells After Restart:**
    *   **Cell 1 (Setup):** This is essential to re-initialize SparkSession, re-mount Drive, and define paths.
    *   **Cell 2 (Data Loading Functions):** To define the helper functions.
    *   **Cell 3 (Load All Raw Data):** This is crucial to reload all your master DataFrames (`client_master_df`, `trades_master_df`, etc.) and persist them. **Without this, subsequent cells that join against these master DataFrames will fail.**
    *   **You DO NOT need to re-run Cells 4 through 10** (Snapshot generation, Base ABT, Recency, Freq/Monetary, Funding/AUM, Deltas) *because their output should already be saved in `temp_abt_path` from your previous successful runs.*

3.  **Attempt to Run Cell 11 Again:**
    *   Once Cells 1, 2, and 3 have completed successfully after the restart, try running the **Revised Cell 11 (Iterative Write for Churn Labels)** again.
    *   The first operation in this cell is `abt_df_iter = spark.read.parquet(current_abt_file_path)`. If the SparkSession is healthy after the restart, this read should succeed, loading the ABT that was saved at the end of Cell 10.

**Why this might work:**

*   A kernel restart gives Spark a fresh start, clearing any unstable state or resource contention that might have led to the Spark components becoming unresponsive.
*   The iterative disk-writing strategy ensures that your progress up to the end of Cell 10 is preserved on disk, so you don't lose that work.

**If the `ConnectionRefusedError` persists even after a kernel restart and re-running Cells 1-3:**

*   **Colab Resource Limits:** You might be hitting fundamental resource limits of the Colab session type you are using (standard vs. Pro vs. Pro+). The operations, even with disk checkpointing, might still be too demanding over time for the free tier.
*   **Issue with a Specific Master DataFrame:** If one of the master DataFrames became corrupted on disk (very unlikely with Parquet) or is excessively large, re-loading it in Cell 3 might trigger issues.
*   **Try a \"Factory reset runtime\":** This is a more aggressive reset than just \"Restart runtime\".

Let's try the kernel restart and re-running Cells 1, 2, 3, and then Cell 11 first. This often resolves such \"Connection refused\" errors in Colab."""),

The reason \"Calculating Condition A...\" (or a similar message explicitly stating the lookback period for Condition A) isn't printed for the 90-day window (and won't be for 270D or 365D) is because of this logic in the **Revised Cell 11**:

```python
        # --- Condition A: Recent Engagement (Lookback) ---
        lookback_period_for_cond_A = n_days_churn_window # Default
        if n_days_churn_window == 60:
            lookback_period_for_cond_A = 30 
            print(f\"      For {n_days_churn_window}D churn, using {lookback_period_for_cond_A}D lookback features for Condition A.\") # This print is INSIDE the if block
        
        lookback_trade_col_A = f\"Trade_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"
        lookback_login_col_A = f\"Login_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"
        # ...
        iter_calc_df = abt_df_iter.withColumn( 
            \"Temp_Condition_A_Flag\",
            (col(lookback_trade_col_A) > 0) | (col(lookback_login_col_A) > 0)
        )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The specific print statement `print(f\" For {n_days_churn_window}D churn, using {lookback_period_for_cond_A}D lookback features for Condition A.\")` is **only executed when `n_days_churn_window == 60`**.
2.  For `n_days_churn_window = 90` (or 270, or 365):
    *   The `if n_days_churn_window == 60:` condition is false.
    *   `lookback_period_for_cond_A` remains equal to `n_days_churn_window` (so, 90 for the 90D window, 270 for 270D, etc.).
    *   The code then directly uses `lookback_trade_col_A = f\"Trade_Days_Count_{n_days_churn_window}D\"` and `lookback_login_col_A = f\"Login_Days_Count_{n_days_churn_window}D\"`.
    *   The actual calculation of `Temp_Condition_A_Flag` *is* happening correctly using these `_90D` (or `_270D`, `_365D`) columns.
    *   We just didn't have an explicit `print` statement for the \"default\" case where the lookback period for Condition A matches the churn window.

**Rest assured, Condition A *is* being calculated for the 90-day, 270-day, and 365-day churn windows.** It's just that the verbose printout about which lookback features are being used was specific to the 60-day proxy scenario.

If you want to see a similar printout for all windows, you could modify the print logic:

```python
        # --- Condition A: Recent Engagement (Lookback) ---
        lookback_period_for_cond_A = n_days_churn_window # Default
        proxy_message = \"\"
        if n_days_churn_window == 60:
            lookback_period_for_cond_A = 30 
            proxy_message = f\" (using {lookback_period_for_cond_A}D features as proxy)\"
        
        print(f\"      Calculating Condition A for {n_days_churn_window}D churn using {lookback_period_for_cond_A}D lookback features{proxy_message}.\")
        
        lookback_trade_col_A = f\"Trade_Days_Count_{lookback_period_for_cond_A}D\"
        # ... rest of the logic
```
This change would make it print the lookback period being used for Condition A for every `n_days_churn_window`. However, the underlying calculation logic in your current \"Revised Cell 11\" for Condition A is correct for all windows (using the 30D proxy for 60D churn, and direct N-day lookbacks for 90D, 270D, 365D churn).

The output you're seeing is expected given the current print statements. The key is that the process is continuing and successfully writing the ABT for each N-day window, which implies the necessary columns for Condition A (either direct or proxy) are being found and used."""),

**This indicates that the entire ABT generation process, from Cell 1 through Cell 12, has completed successfully.**

Let's break down the significance of the Cell 12 output:

1.  **`Final ABT has 33,197,513 rows and 91 columns.`**
    *   **Rows:** The number of rows `33,197,513` is slightly less than the `33,681,785` client-snapshot pairs we had before the final filtering in Cell 12. This reduction is due to the filter:
        ```python
        min_tenure_for_abt = 90 # days, example
        final_abt_df = final_abt_df.filter(col(\"Tenure_Days\") >= min_tenure_for_abt)
        ```
        This filtered out client-snapshots where the client's tenure was less than 90 days at the time of the snapshot. This is a common and reasonable filtering step.
    *   **Columns:** 91 columns represent a very rich feature set! This includes:
        *   Keys (`ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate`, `ActivationDate`)
        *   `Tenure_Days`
        *   Recency Features (Last\\_Date and Days\\_Since\\_Last\\_ for Trade, Login, Deposit, Payout)
        *   Frequency & Monetary Features (Days\\_Count, Txns\\_Count, Sum for multiple lookbacks - 30D, 90D, 180D, 270D, 365D - for Trade, Login, Deposit, Payout)
        *   Funding Flow Features (Net\\_Funding, Payout\\_To\\_Deposit\\_Ratio for multiple lookbacks)
        *   AUM Features (`AUM_SnapshotMonth_Monthly`, `AUM_SnapshotMonth_RunningTotal`)
        *   Payout Risk Features (`Total_Payout_In_Snapshot_Month`, `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth`, `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`, `Payout_Risk_Flag`)
        *   Delta Features (`_90D_Delta` for Trade Days, Login Days, Brokerage Sum)
        *   Churn Labels (`Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`, `_90Days`, `_270Days`, `_365Days`)
        *   Possibly some intermediate columns if not all were dropped (e.g., `PreviousMonthEOM` if you kept it for inspection).

2.  **`Writing final ABT to: /content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet`**
    *   This confirms the ABT is being saved to the correct **final destination path** (not the `temp_abt_path`).
    *   The `mode(\"overwrite\")` ensures that if an old version existed, it's replaced.

3.  **`Final ABT successfully saved.`**
    *   The most important confirmation!

4.  **`Unpersisted master dataframes.`**
    *   Good cleanup of the initially loaded master data.

5.  **`Spark session stopped.`**
    *   Proper termination of the Spark session.

**Congratulations! You have successfully generated your comprehensive Analytical Base Table.**

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Verify ABT Content (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   In a new notebook, or by restarting the kernel and running just a few cells, you can load a sample of the final Parquet ABT to inspect its schema and a few rows to ensure everything looks as expected.
        ```python
        from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
        spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"ABTCheck\").getOrCreate()
        abt_final_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet\"
        abt = spark.read.parquet(abt_final_path)
        abt.printSchema()
        abt.show(10, truncate=False)
        print(f\"ABT Row Count: {abt.count()}\")
        print(f\"ABT Column Count: {len(abt.columns)}\")
        spark.stop()
        ```

2.  **Proceed to Modeling (`Churn_Modeling.ipynb`):**
    *   You are now ready to move to the `Churn_Modeling.ipynb` notebook.
    *   The first step there will be to load this newly created ABT.
    *   Then, you'll select a target variable (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`).
    *   Perform train/test split (time-based).
    *   Apply feature vectorization and scaling.
    *   Train your ML models (starting with Logistic Regression, then Random Forest, etc.).
    *   Evaluate performance and iterate.

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Yes, this is the perfect time to add the classification columns based on the Excel logic, especially since you want them in the ABT *before* modeling (even if not directly used *as features* in the first iteration of model training, they will be there for analysis and potential future feature use).

The output of Cell 12 looks good:
*   `Final ABT has 33,197,513 rows and 91 columns.` - This is the fully featured ABT with churn labels.
*   The sample data shows a rich set of features.
*   The `printSchema()` confirms the column names and types.

**You want to add the Excel-based classification (Total Score -> Slab/Tag) to this final ABT.**

**Plan for Adding Classification (New Cell 13):**

1.  **Read the Final ABT:** Load the Parquet file that Cell 12 just wrote (the one at `output_path_parquet`).
2.  **Ensure Necessary Input Columns for Classification Exist:**
    The Excel logic requires inputs like:
    *   `Last 36 M DAYS TRADED`: We have `Trade_Days_Count_365D` (which is 12 months, not 36, but it's the closest. We can use this or acknowledge the difference). For a more accurate 36M, we'd need to calculate it specifically.
    *   `36 M BROK`: Similar to above, we have `Trade_Sum_365D`.
    *   `AUM_AH_CUT` (for the snapshot month): We have `AUM_SnapshotMonth_Monthly`.
    *   `6 M Brok`: We have `Trade_Sum_180D`.
    *   `Max 6/36 M Brok`: We can calculate this using `Trade_Sum_180D` and `Trade_Sum_365D`.
    *   `BROKTILLDATE (L)`: This was interpreted as cumulative brokerage. We don't have a direct \"lifetime cumulative brokerage up to snapshot\" feature yet. We could calculate it, or use a long-term brokerage sum like `Trade_Sum_365D` as a proxy if the Excel's `BROKTILLDATE` specifically meant \"brokerage in the current analysis period/year.\"
    *   `LASTTRADEDATE (M)`: We have `Last_Trade_Date`.
    *   `FIRSTTRADEDATE (N)`: Not directly in the ABT, but `ActivationDate` serves a similar purpose for tenure. The Excel logic used `M4-O4` for `LifeTime`. We have `Tenure_Days` (`SnapshotDate - ActivationDate`). If `FIRSTTRADEDATE` is different from `ACTIVATIONDATE` and crucial, we'd need it.
    *   `ACTIVATIONDATE (O)`: We have `ActivationDate`.
    *   `Last Cash in Date (P)`: We have `Last_Deposit_Date`.
    *   `Last Login Date (Q)`: We have `Last_Login_Date`.
    *   `Status Score (S)`: You confirmed this is a **fixed 100** for this historical replication.
    *   `Analysis Date`: This will be the `SnapshotDate` for each row.
    *   **Fixed Targets:** We decided to use the fixed targets (54.3, 258084, 6671.10).
    *   **Algo Sheet Parameters:** Weights and Max Scores (constants).
    *   **Slab Lookup Table:** Constants.

3.  **Implement Excel Formulas in PySpark:**
    *   Translate each formula step-by-step using `withColumn`.
    *   `Max_6_36_M_Brok_Calc`
    *   `LifeTime_Calc` (or use `Tenure_Days`)
    *   `Trading_Days_TARGET_Fixed`, `Trading_Days_ACHIEVEMENT`, `Trading_Days_SCORE`
    *   `AUM_TARGET_Fixed`, `AUM_ACHIEVEMENT`, `AUM_SCORE`
    *   `Brokerage_TARGET_Fixed`, `Brokerage_ACHIEVEMENT`, `Brokerage_SCORE`
    *   `Recency_TARGET_Fixed`, `Recency_ACHIEVEMENT`, `Recency_SCORE`
    *   `TOTAL_SCORE_Calc`
    *   `Slab_Lookup_Calc` (using `when().otherwise()`)
    *   `Score_Slab_Calc` (the age-based adjustment)
    *   `Tag_Calc` (final textual tag)

4.  **Add New Columns:** Add `Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Tag` (and maybe intermediate scores if useful) to the ABT.
5.  **Overwrite the Final ABT:** Save the ABT with these new classification columns back to `output_path_parquet`.

**Let's start coding Cell 13. We need to be careful with column name mapping.**

**Key Assumptions and Decisions in Cell 13:**

*   **36M Proxies:** `Trade_Days_Count_365D` and `Trade_Sum_365D` are used as 12-month proxies for the Excel's \"36 Month\" figures. This is a significant difference and should be noted. If true 36-month lookbacks are needed, Cell 7 would need to calculate them.
*   **`BROKTILLDATE` (Excel L4) for Brokerage Achievement:** The logic now uses the calculated `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` for brokerage achievement. This makes the achievement metric consistent with how `TARGET_BROKERAGE_FIXED` was derived (from an average of Max 6/36 M Brok).
*   **`LifeTime` (Excel R4):** `Tenure_Days` from the ABT is used.
*   **Recency Score (AD4/AE4):** The `Max_Activity_Date_For_Recency` correctly combines `Last_Trade_Date`, `ActivationDate`, `Last_Deposit_Date`, and `Last_Login_Date`. `coalesce` is used to handle nulls in these dates by defaulting them to a very old date relative to `SnapshotDate` so they don't incorrectly become the maximum.
*   **AH4 (Score Slab) Logic:** The interpretation of `IF($AE$1-O4>90,AG4,IF(AG4>450,AG4,\"-1\"))` has been:
    *   If `Tenure_Days > 90`, the numeric slab is `Temp_AG4_Numeric_Slab` (derived from Total Score).
    *   If `Tenure_Days <= 90` (young client):
        *   AND if their `Temp_AG4_Numeric_Slab` is `>= 450.0` (Silver, Gold, Platinum etc.), they keep that numeric slab.
        *   Else (if their `Temp_AG4_Numeric_Slab` is Classic (0.0) or New (-1.0)), their numeric slab becomes `-1.0` (New).
    *   This seems to be the closest PySpark equivalent to the Excel formula provided earlier where AG4 was textual but the comparison was numeric.

**Before Running Cell 13:**

1.  **Spark Session:** Ensure your SparkSession is active. If you ran `spark.stop()` at the end of Cell 12, you'll need to re-run Cell 1 (Setup) to reinitialize Spark. You also need to re-run Cell 3 to load the master dataframes because the classification logic will refer to columns from `abt_df_for_classification` which in turn were created using those master dataframes (though not directly joined in *this* cell, the source columns matter).
    *   **Correction:** Cell 13 *reads* the final ABT from Parquet. So, you only need SparkSession active. The master dataframes are not directly needed for this cell *if all required input columns are already in the ABT Parquet file*. The current `abt_df_for_classification` reads from `output_path_parquet`.
2.  **Input Columns:** Double-check that all the ABT columns used as inputs (e.g., `Trade_Days_Count_365D`, `AUM_SnapshotMonth_Monthly`, `Last_Trade_Date`, etc.) actually exist in the `output_path_parquet` file with those exact names. The `printSchema()` from the verification step after Cell 12 should confirm this.
3.  **Review Assumptions:** Be comfortable with the proxy decisions (e.g., 12M data for 36M Excel inputs).

This cell will add `Historical_Total_Score` and `Historical_Tag` to your ABT and overwrite the final Parquet file."""),

**Previous Assumption for `Status Score (S)` in Cell 13:**
We assumed `STATUS_SCORE_S_FIXED = 100.0` for all clients because determining historical \"Active/Dormant\" for each snapshot (for the purpose of *creating features*) was complex and we decided to defer that specific type of classification to post-prediction.

**New Proposal for `Status Score (S)` for Cell 13's Classification:**

You want to derive `Status Score (S)` based on one of the **churn labels already present in the ABT** (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`).

*   If `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days == 0` (Not Churned / considered \"Active\" for this purpose) => `Status Score = 100`.
*   If `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days == 1` (Churned / considered \"Dormant\" for this purpose):
    *   Then apply the logic: `IF(FIRSTTRADEDATE is null/zero, 0, 75)`
        *   We don't have `FIRSTTRADEDATE` directly. We can use `Last_Trade_Date` as a proxy: if a client is \"Dormant\" (churned=1) AND their `Last_Trade_Date` is null (meaning they effectively never traded, or at least not in a way that's recorded leading up to this snapshot), then `Status Score = 0`.
        *   If they are \"Dormant\" (churned=1) AND their `Last_Trade_Date` is NOT null (meaning they traded at some point), then `Status Score = 75`.

**Implications of this New Proposal for Cell 13:**

1.  **Choosing the \"Driving\" Churn Label:** Which churn label should drive this Status Score? `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`, `_90Days`, `_270Days`, or `_365Days`? The choice will affect the classification. Let's assume you want to use **`Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`** as it represents a longer-term status.
2.  **Circular Reference if Used for Modeling *This Same Churn Label*:**
    *   If you calculate `Historical_Tag` using a `Status Score` derived from `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`, and then you try to use `Historical_Tag` as a feature to predict `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`, you create a direct circular dependency (data leakage). The target is influencing a feature used to predict itself.
    *   **You previously stated: \"I dont intend to use these new fields in modeling, just an extra field when checking for info manually.\" This is key! If this holds true, then using the churn label to derive the Status Score for this descriptive classification is fine.**

3.  **Interpretation:** The resulting `Historical_Tag` will now be a composite descriptor that reflects not only the client's activity leading up to the snapshot (AUM, trade recency, etc.) but also their *future outcome* over the next year (as captured by `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`). This is perfectly valid for an analytical/descriptive tag.

**Revised Cell 13 with Dynamic Status Score:**

**Key Changes in this Revised Cell 13:**

1.  **`CHURN_LABEL_FOR_STATUS_SCORE`:** A variable is defined (defaulting to `\"Is_Churned_Engage_365Days\"`) to specify which churn label will determine the \"Active/Dormant\" status for the `Status Score`.
2.  **Dynamic `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` Calculation:**
    *   It checks the chosen `CHURN_LABEL_FOR_STATUS_SCORE`.
    *   If `0` (Not Churned), `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` is `100.0`.
    *   If `1` (Churned):
        *   If `Last_Trade_Date` is null, `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` is `0.0`.
        *   Else (Churned and has a `Last_Trade_Date`), `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` is `75.0`.
3.  **Use of Dynamic Status Score:** The `Excel_Score_TradeDays` calculation now uses `col(\"Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic\")` instead of the fixed `STATUS_SCORE_S_FIXED`.
4.  **Column Selection for Final ABT:** The code for selecting final columns is made more explicit to ensure all original ABT columns are retained and only the desired new classification columns (`Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Tag`, and the `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` itself for reference) are added. Intermediate calculation columns are implicitly dropped by this selection unless you choose to keep them.

**Before Running this Revised Cell 13:**

*   **Ensure Cell 12 has run successfully** and the ABT (with churn labels but *without* this Excel classification) is saved to `output_path_parquet`. Cell 13 now reads directly from this final path.
*   **Verify Churn Label Column Name:** Double-check that `CHURN_LABEL_FOR_STATUS_SCORE = \"Is_Churned_Engage_365Days\"` exactly matches the column name of the 365-day churn label in your ABT.
*   **Spark Session:** Ensure SparkSession is active (re-run Cell 1 if needed).

This will add the Excel-based classification to your final ABT, with the Status Score dynamically determined by the client's 365-day churn outcome. Remember this resulting tag is for analytical richness and not for direct use as a feature to predict the *same* 365-day churn label."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Before you run the **Revised Cell 13 (Historical Excel-Based Classification with Dynamic Status Score)**, let's quickly clarify and confirm a few crucial points to ensure it runs smoothly and aligns perfectly with your intentions:

1.  **Source of ABT for Cell 13:**
    *   The first line of Cell 13 is `abt_df_for_classification = spark.read.parquet(output_path_parquet)`.
    *   **Confirmation:** Is `output_path_parquet` (defined in Cell 1 as `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet`) indeed the location where the output of **Cell 12 (Final Filtering, fillna, and Final ABT Save)** was written?
    *   Essentially, Cell 13 should read the ABT that already contains all previously engineered features AND the four churn labels (`Is_Churned_Engage_...Days`).

2.  **Churn Label for `Status_Score` Derivation:**
    *   In Cell 13, I've set:
        `CHURN_LABEL_FOR_STATUS_SCORE = \"Is_Churned_Engage_365Days\"`
    *   **Confirmation:** Is using the `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` label to determine the \"Active/Dormant\" status for the dynamic `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` your preferred choice? You could use `_270Days`, `_90Days`, or `_60Days` if you feel one of those better represents the \"status\" you want to feed into the Excel classification logic. The 365-day one is a reasonable default for a longer-term status.

3.  **Input Columns for Excel Logic - Proxies and Availability:**
    *   **36M Trade Days/Brokerage:** We are using `Trade_Days_Count_365D` and `Trade_Sum_365D` as 12-month proxies. Are you comfortable with this approximation for this classification task? (Creating true 36M lookbacks would require modifying Cell 7 significantly).
    *   **`BROKTILLDATE` (Excel L4 for Brokerage Achievement):** We decided to use the calculated `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` for the achievement part of the Brokerage Score. This makes it consistent with how `TARGET_BROKERAGE_FIXED` was defined. Is this alignment acceptable?
    *   **`FIRSTTRADEDATE` (Excel N4):** The Excel formula for `LifeTime` (R4) was `IF(M4>0,(M4-O4),0)`. Our `Excel_Score_TradeDays` calculation currently uses `Tenure_Days` (from ABT, which is `SnapshotDate - ActivationDate`) as the basis for how long a client has been around, and the `STATUS_SCORE_S_FIXED` (now dynamic) is added. The original `LifeTime` was not directly used as an input to a *score component* in the formulas we analyzed, but rather `Status Score` was column S. Our current approach seems okay, but just confirming.
    *   **All other input columns** (like `AUM_SnapshotMonth_Monthly`, `Trade_Sum_180D`, recency dates, etc.) should be present from the previous ABT generation steps. The schema dump after Cell 12 was very helpful in confirming this.

4.  **Interpretation of the `Historical_Tag`:**
    *   Just to reiterate: because the `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` will now be influenced by a *future* churn label (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`), the resulting `Historical_Tag` will be a descriptor that combines historical activity patterns with this known future outcome. It's an *analytical tag* reflecting a client's profile *given we know their long-term churn status*.
    *   This is fine, as per your statement: \"I dont intend to use these new fields in modeling, just an extra field when checking for info manually.\"

5.  **Final Output Columns:**
    *   The revised Cell 13 aims to select all original columns from the input ABT plus the new `Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Tag`, and `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic`. Intermediate Excel calculation columns (like `Excel_TradeDays_Achievement`) are dropped by default. Is this selection what you want for the final ABT? Or would you prefer to keep some of those intermediate Excel score components as well?

If you can confirm these points, especially the churn label to use for status (point 2) and your comfort with the proxies (point 3), then we should be good to run the revised Cell 13. The code itself looks robust for the logic described."""),

Let's break down point #3 about \"36M Trade Days/Brokerage\" and \"Max(6/36 M BROK)\".

**Current State in Cell 13 (and ABT from previous cells):**
*   We have `Trade_Days_Count_365D` and `Trade_Sum_365D` (representing the last 12 months of activity from the `SnapshotDate`).
*   We have `Trade_Sum_180D` (representing the last 6 months of brokerage).
*   The current `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` uses `MAX(Trade_Sum_180D, Trade_Sum_365D / 6.0)`. This is effectively Max(Last 6M Brok, Avg Monthly Brok over Last 12M).

**Your Proposal for a More Accurate \"36M\" Representation:**

You're suggesting that for the Excel classification's \"36M\" inputs, we should try to use data that truly reflects the last 3 years (approx. 36 months = 3 * 365 days = 1095 days).

**Can we do this in Cell 13 without re-running Cell 7?**

*   **No, not directly if Cell 7 only calculated up to `_365D` lookbacks.**
*   Cell 7 (Frequency and Monetary Features) is where features like `Trade_Days_Count_XD` and `Trade_Sum_XD` are computed based on the `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` list. If `1095` (or a similar 3-year equivalent) was not in that list when Cell 7 ran, then columns like `Trade_Days_Count_1095D` and `Trade_Sum_1095D` **do not exist** in the ABT that Cell 13 is reading.

**Path Forward for Point #3:**

**Option 1: Use Existing Proxies (Current Cell 13 Logic - Simplest, No Re-runs)**
    *   Continue using `Trade_Days_Count_365D` as a proxy for \"36M Trade Days.\"
    *   Continue using `Trade_Sum_365D` as a proxy for \"36M Brokerage.\"
    *   The `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` would remain `MAX(Trade_Sum_180D, Trade_Sum_365D / 6.0)`.
    *   **Pro:** No need to re-run heavy cells. We accept the limitation that our \"36M\" is actually \"12M.\"
    *   **Con:** Less faithful to the original Excel logic's 36-month scope.

**Option 2: Calculate Specific 3-Year Lookbacks *Now* (New Cell before Cell 13, or modify Cell 13)**
    *   We could add a new cell (say, Cell 12.5) or modify the beginning of Cell 13 to specifically calculate:
        *   `Trade_Days_Count_1095D` (3 years)
        *   `Trade_Sum_1095D` (3 years)
    *   This would involve reading the ABT from `output_path_parquet` (as Cell 13 does), then using a simplified version of the `calculate_feature_block` logic from Cell 7, but *only* for `days = 1095` and *only* for Trade activity.
    *   Then, Cell 13's classification logic would use these newly computed `_1095D` columns for the \"36M\" parts.
    *   The `Excel_Max_6_36M_Brok_Calc` would then become `MAX(Trade_Sum_180D, Trade_Sum_1095D / (1095/30.44) / 6) ` (No, simpler: `MAX(Trade_Sum_180D, Trade_Sum_1095D / (36/6)) = MAX(Trade_Sum_180D, Trade_Sum_1095D / 6.0)` assuming `Trade_Sum_1095D` is the sum over 36 months, so `Trade_Sum_1095D / 6` would be like an average 6-month block from that 36-month total. Or more accurately, `Trade_Sum_1095D / 36` is avg monthly, so `(Trade_Sum_1095D / 36) * 1` if the formula was comparing 6M actual vs 1M average from 36M. The excel was `F4/6` which was `36M_BROK / 6`. So if we have `Trade_Sum_1095D` as the 36M total, then `Trade_Sum_1095D / 6` is not the monthly average. It's 1/6th of the 36M total. This is an odd comparison.
    Let's re-check the original Excel for J4: `J4 (Max 6/36 M Brok): =MAX(I4,F4/6)`.
    I4 = `6 M Brok`. F4 = `36 M BROK`. So it's `MAX(Actual 6M Brok, (Total 36M Brok)/6 )`.
    If we have `Trade_Sum_1095D` as our 36M Brokerage, then it would be `MAX(Trade_Sum_180D, Trade_Sum_1095D / 6.0)`.
    *   **Pro:** More accurate to the 36-month intent of the Excel file.
    *   **Con:** Adds another processing step that involves joins with `trades_master_df`, which could be time-consuming, though more targeted than a full Cell 7 re-run.

**Option 3: Re-run Cell 7 with Updated `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` (Most Accurate, Most Time)**
    *   Update `LOOKBACK_PERIODS_DAYS` in Cell 1 to include `1095` (and `60` if not already there for churn labels).
    *   Re-run Cell 7 (the 4-hour cell).
    *   Then Cell 13 can directly use `Trade_Days_Count_1095D` and `Trade_Sum_1095D`.
    *   **Pro:** All features consistently generated.
    *   **Con:** Significant time investment.

**Recommendation Given Your Desire to Avoid Re-running Cell 7:**

**Let's go with Option 2. It's a good compromise.** We will add logic at the beginning of Cell 13 to specifically calculate `Trade_Days_Count_1095D` and `Trade_Sum_1095D`. This will make the \"36M\" inputs more accurate for the classification.

The `Max(6/36 M BROK)` feature needs `Trade_Sum_180D` (which we have) and the 36M brokerage. So calculating `Trade_Sum_1095D` will enable this.

---
**Revised Cell 13 - Plan:**

1.  **Read ABT from `output_path_parquet`** (this is the ABT from Cell 12, containing all features up to `_365D` lookbacks, plus churn labels).
2.  **NEW Sub-Step: Calculate Specific 1095-Day Trade Lookbacks:**
    *   Use `trades_master_df` (ensure it's loaded and persisted from Cell 3 if kernel was restarted).
    *   Join with `abt_df.select(\"ClientCode\", \"SnapshotDate\")`.
    *   Filter trades for the 1095-day window before each snapshot.
    *   Aggregate to get `Trade_Days_Count_1095D` and `Trade_Sum_1095D`.
    *   Join these two new columns back to the `abt_df`.
3.  **Proceed with the rest of the classification logic in Cell 13**, but now:
    *   Use `Trade_Days_Count_1095D` where Excel used \"36M Trade Days.\"
    *   Use `Trade_Sum_1095D` where Excel used \"36M Brokerage.\"
    *   Calculate `Excel_Max_6_36M_Brok_Calc` as `greatest(col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\"), col(\"Trade_Sum_1095D\") / 6.0)`.

This seems like the best path forward. It adds a targeted calculation for the missing long-term lookbacks needed for a more faithful Excel logic replication without redoing all of Cell 7.

**Before I provide the updated Cell 13 code, please confirm:**
*   Is `trades_master_df` (loaded in Cell 3) still available and persisted if you were to run a new Cell 13? If your kernel restarted, you **MUST** re-run Cells 1, 2, and 3 to load master data.
*   Are you okay with the additional processing time this new sub-step in Cell 13 will introduce? (It will be less than a full Cell 7 re-run but more than if we used 365D proxies).

Once you confirm, I'll draft the updated Cell 13."""),

This means:

1.  We will **NOT** calculate new `_1095D` (3-year) lookbacks in Cell 13.
2.  For the Excel classification logic that refers to \"36 Month\" data, we will continue to use the existing `_365D` (1-year) features as proxies:
    *   \"36M Trade Days\" will be proxied by `Trade_Days_Count_365D`.
    *   \"36M Brokerage\" will be proxied by `Trade_Sum_365D`.
3.  The `Max 6/36 M Brok` calculation will use these proxies: `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc = greatest(col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\"), col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\") / 6.0)`.
4.  The dynamic `Status Score` logic (based on `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`) will remain as discussed.

This is the quickest way to add the classification layer, and we acknowledge the proxy approximation for the 36-month metrics. This is perfectly fine, especially since the primary goal is to have these classification tags for analytical richness rather than as highly precise input features for the immediate next modeling step.

The \"Revised Cell 13 with Dynamic Status Score\" I provided previously already implements this Option 1 logic. There are no further code changes needed to that specific version of Cell 13 if we are proceeding with Option 1.

**Therefore, you can use the \"Revised Cell 13 with Dynamic Status Score\" from this message:** [Link to the message where Revised Cell 13 was last provided by me - the one that starts with `\"# --- 13.

**Key confirmations in this version for Option 1:**
*   The dynamic status score logic is present.
*   All \"36M\" references use the `_365D` proxy columns (e.g., `Trade_Days_Count_365D`).
*   `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` uses `Trade_Sum_180D` and `Trade_Sum_365D / 6.0`.
*   Added `coalesce` around the sum for `Historical_Total_Score` to handle potential nulls from individual score components before casting to Int, although the `fillna(0.0)` on individual scores should prevent this.
*   Slightly improved the `greatest` logic for `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` to handle nulls more explicitly before the `greatest` function.
*   Corrected the `Days_Since_Max_Activity_For_Recency` to handle cases where all underlying dates might be null by defaulting to a large recency.
*   Refined final column selection to ensure order and avoid errors if a new column name somehow matched an old one.

This version should be ready to run with the \"Option 1\" strategy.

This error is very specific. It means that somewhere in your `when(condition, value)` constructs, the `condition` part is evaluating to a Python boolean (`True` or `False`) *before* Spark gets to process it as a Spark SQL Column expression. Spark's `when` function expects its condition to be a `Column` object that will be evaluated row by row within Spark.

Let's examine the `when` conditions in the corrected Cell 13 to find the culprit. The error occurred after the print statement \"Calculating intermediate values for classification...\", so it's likely in the `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` or one of the initial score component calculations.

The first `when` after that print is:
```python
    df = df.withColumn(\"Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc\", 
                       when(col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\").isNotNull() & col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\").isNotNull(), # <--- Problem Area
                            greatest(col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\"), (col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\") / 6.0))) 
                       .when(col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\").isNotNull(), col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\")) # <--- Also here
                       .when(col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\").isNotNull(), (col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\") / 6.0)) # <--- And here
                       .otherwise(0.0)
                      )
```

**The Issue:**
The conditions like `col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\").isNotNull() & col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\").isNotNull()` are PySpark Column expressions. However, if you write a Python `and` or `or` between two Spark Column conditions, Python might try to evaluate them to a single boolean *if the context allows*, or it might not be what Spark's `when` expects directly.

For multiple conditions within a Spark `when`, you should chain them using Spark's bitwise operators `&` (for AND) and `|` (for OR), and ensure the entire expression remains a Spark Column.

The expression `col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\").isNotNull() & col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\").isNotNull()` *should* work correctly and return a Column of booleans.

Let's look closely at the traceback again. It's specifically complaining about the `condition` argument.

The structure of a chained `when.when.otherwise` is:
`when(condition1, value1).when(condition2, value2).otherwise(defaultValue)`

The error means one of these `conditionX` parts is not a `Column`.

**Re-examining the logic for `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc`:**

The structure is:
```python
when(cond1_both_not_null, greatest(...))
.when(cond2_180D_not_null, col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\"))
.when(cond3_365D_not_null, col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\") / 6.0)
.otherwise(0.0)
```
Each `condX` needs to be a Spark `Column` object.
*   `col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\").isNotNull() & col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\").isNotNull()` IS a Spark Column of booleans.
*   `col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\").isNotNull()` IS a Spark Column of booleans.
*   `col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\").isNotNull()` IS a Spark Column of booleans.

This part *should* be correct.

Could the issue be in how `greatest` or `/ 6.0` interacts if one of the columns inside is null, *before* the `when` condition even filters? No, `greatest` handles nulls (returns null if any input is null unless all are null, then also null). Division by null is null.

Let's consider the `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` calculation just before it:
```python
    df = df.withColumn(\"Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic\",
        when(col(CHURN_LABEL_FOR_STATUS_SCORE) == 0, 100.0) 
        .when(col(CHURN_LABEL_FOR_STATUS_SCORE) == 1, 
              when(col(\"Last_Trade_Date\").isNull(), 0.0) # Inner when
              .otherwise(75.0) 
             )
        .otherwise(100.0) 
    )
```
This structure is also correct. `col(CHURN_LABEL_FOR_STATUS_SCORE) == 0` is a Column, as is `col(CHURN_LABEL_FOR_STATUS_SCORE) == 1`, and `col(\"Last_Trade_Date\").isNull()`.

**Let's simplify the `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` to see if the complexity of the chained `when` is the issue, or if there's a more fundamental problem with the `df` state or a preceding line.**

Sometimes, the error points to a line, but the actual issue was set up by a previous operation that resulted in an unexpected type.

What if `Trade_Sum_180D` or `Trade_Sum_365D` were *not* actually Doubles as expected from Cell 7? If they were some other type, `isNotNull()` might behave differently or the division/`greatest` might fail in a way that confuses the `when` condition.

Let's check the schema of `abt_df_for_classification` just before this calculation in Cell 13.

Add this temporarily at the start of the `try` block in Cell 13:
```python
    # ... (after reading abt_df_for_classification and persisting)
    print(\"Schema of abt_df_for_classification before Excel logic:\")
    abt_df_for_classification.printSchema()
    
    # Check specific columns
    print(f\"Type of Trade_Sum_180D: {type(abt_df_for_classification.schema['Trade_Sum_180D'].dataType)}\")
    print(f\"Type of Trade_Sum_365D: {type(abt_df_for_classification.schema['Trade_Sum_365D'].dataType)}\")
    
    df = abt_df_for_classification
    # ... rest of the code
```

The output for these types should be `pyspark.sql.types.DoubleType`.

If the types are correct, the next most likely culprit is the chained `when` for `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc`.
Let's try to rewrite it with nested `when`s, which can sometimes be clearer for Spark to parse, or by using `coalesce` more directly.

**Alternative for `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc`:**

```python
    # Alternative for Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc
    # Calculate components first, handling nulls with coalesce to 0 for calculation if appropriate
    val_180d = coalesce(col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\"), lit(0.0))
    val_365d_div_6 = coalesce(col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\") / 6.0, lit(0.0)) # Division by null or null itself becomes 0

    # If both original values were null, result should be 0. Otherwise, one of them is non-zero.
    # This logic implies that if one is present and the other is null, we take the present one.
    # If both are present, we take the greatest.
    # If both are null (now 0.0), greatest(0.0, 0.0) is 0.0.
    
    df = df.withColumn(\"Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc_v2\",
        greatest(
            coalesce(col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\"), lit(float('-inf'))), # If null, treat as very small for greatest
            coalesce(col(\"Trade_Sum_365D\") / 6.0, lit(float('-inf')))
        )
    )
    # If both were null (became -inf), then the result is -inf. We need to make it 0.
    df = df.withColumn(\"Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc\",
        when(col(\"Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc_v2\") == float('-inf'), lit(0.0))
        .otherwise(col(\"Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc_v2\"))
    ).drop(\"Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc_v2\")
```
This revised logic for `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` first tries to compute the two values that `greatest` will operate on. If `Trade_Sum_180D` is null, `coalesce(col(\"Trade_Sum_180D\"), lit(float('-inf')))` makes it negative infinity, so it won't be chosen by `greatest` unless the other term is also negative infinity. Same for the `Trade_Sum_365D / 6.0` term.
If both inputs to `greatest` end up as negative infinity (meaning both `Trade_Sum_180D` and `Trade_Sum_365D` were null), then `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc_v2` will be negative infinity. The subsequent `when` condition changes this to `0.0`.

This is more robust to nulls *within* the `greatest` function.

Let's integrate this alternative into Cell 13.

**Key changes in this version:**
1.  **Added Imports:** `greatest`, `least`, `pyspark_round` (as an alternative to `expr(\"round(...)\")`) and more type imports at the top of the cell.
2.  **Schema Verification:** Added a small block to print the data types of key input columns to help catch type mismatches early.
3.  **Robust `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc`:** Implemented the more robust null handling for `greatest`.
4.  **`lit()` for constants:** Wrapped numerical constants like `TARGET_TRADE_DAYS_FIXED`, `WEIGHT_TRADE_DAYS` etc. with `lit()` when used directly in arithmetic with Columns. This explicitly tells Spark they are literal values. This can sometimes help avoid type inference issues or the \"condition should be a Column\" error if Spark misinterprets a Python float as a boolean condition.
5.  **`coalesce` for `AUM_SnapshotMonth_Monthly`:** Added `coalesce` before `greatest` for AUM achievement.
6.  **`pyspark_round`:** Used `pyspark_round()` instead of `expr(\"round(...)\")` for consistency, though `expr` is also fine.

Try running this version. The added imports and the more robust `Excel_Max_6_12M_Brok_Calc` logic, along with `lit()` for constants, should address the `PySparkTypeError`. The schema verification print will also be helpful."""),

Okay, we're back to the `OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`, this time in Cell 13 (Excel Classification), specifically when an action (`.count()`) is called after the `final_classified_abt_df.persist()`.

The print statements indicate it successfully read the ABT from Cell 12's output and got through the \"Calculating Dynamic Status Score\" and \"Calculating intermediate values for classification\" print messages. The error seems to happen when it tries to materialize `final_classified_abt_df` for the `.persist()` and subsequent `.count()`.

**Analysis of the Situation:**

1.  **Input ABT Size:** `Read final ABT ... with 33,197,513 rows.` This is the ABT *after* Cell 12's final filtering (min tenure).
2.  **Operations in Cell 13:** This cell adds several new columns based on Excel logic. While each individual `withColumn` operation might not seem excessively heavy, the cumulative effect of adding many columns to a DataFrame with ~33 million rows can significantly increase its in-memory size and the complexity of its logical plan.
3.  **`persist()` and `count()`:** These are actions that force Spark to compute and materialize the DataFrame. If the DataFrame is too large to fit in memory, even after optimizations, `persist()` will fail with an OOM.

**Even though we're not using the iterative disk write *within* Cell 13 (because it's the *last* feature addition step before the final save), the DataFrame itself has become too large for Colab's memory during the materialization required by `persist()` or `count()`.**

**Strategies to Mitigate OOM in Cell 13:**

1.  **Remove the `.persist()` before `.count()` and Final Write (Risky but might pass):**
    *   Sometimes, `persist()` itself is what triggers the OOM if the DataFrame is just on the edge of fitting. If we remove the `final_classified_abt_df.persist()` and let the `.count()` and subsequent `.write.parquet()` actions compute directly, Spark *might* be able to stream the data through without trying to hold it all in memory for caching. This is less efficient for repeated actions but might avoid the specific OOM during caching.
    *   **Change:**
        ```python
        # final_classified_abt_df.persist() # Comment this out
        classified_abt_count = final_classified_abt_df.count() # This will still be an action
        ```
    *   Then, if the `.count()` passes, the `.write.parquet()` might also pass.

2.  **Selective Column Dropping *Before* Persist/Write (If some intermediate Excel columns are not needed):**
    *   In Cell 13, we calculate many `Excel_...` columns. If these are purely intermediate and not needed in the final saved ABT, explicitly dropping them *before* the `persist()` and `count()` can reduce the DataFrame's width.
    *   Current final selection:
        ```python
        original_abt_cols = abt_df_for_classification.columns
        new_classification_cols = [\"Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic\", \"Historical_Total_Score\", \"Historical_Tag\"]
        cols_to_select_ordered = original_abt_cols + [c for c in new_classification_cols if c in df.columns and c not in original_abt_cols]
        final_classified_abt_df = df.select(cols_to_select_ordered)
        ```
        This already does a selection. Ensure `df` before this `select` doesn't have too many unnecessary columns carried over. The `df.select(cols_to_select_ordered)` should create the `final_classified_abt_df` with only the desired columns. The issue might be that `df` itself (before this final select) is too large when an action is called.

3.  **Checkpointing the Input ABT (More Aggressive):**
    *   If `abt_df_for_classification` (read from `output_path_parquet` at the start of Cell 13) has a very complex lineage from previous cells (even though it was written to Parquet), checkpointing *it* after reading could simplify the plan for subsequent operations in Cell 13.
    *   **Add at the start of Cell 13:**
        ```python
        # At the beginning of the try block in Cell 13
        # Set a checkpoint directory if not already set
        # spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir(os.path.join(google_drive_base_path, \"spark_checkpoints\")) # Choose a path on Drive

        abt_df_for_classification = spark.read.parquet(output_path_parquet)
        print(f\"Read final ABT from {output_path_parquet} with {abt_df_for_classification.count()} rows.\") # Count might be an issue here too if df is huge
        
        # Forcing a checkpoint early
        # abt_df_for_classification = abt_df_for_classification.checkpoint() # Eager checkpoint
        # print(\"Checkpointed input ABT for classification cell.\")
        
        # Or use persist only
        abt_df_for_classification.persist()
        # df_count_check = abt_df_for_classification.count() # Trigger action to ensure it's cached
        # print(f\"Input ABT count: {df_count_check}\")
        ```
        Using `checkpoint()` is heavy (writes to disk again). `persist()` is already there. The `count()` action right after `persist()` ensures it's materialized. If this initial `count()` itself fails, then the input ABT from Cell 12 is already problematic to hold.

4.  **Reduce `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` or other Spark configs (Experimental for Colab):**
    *   As discussed before, try setting this in Cell 1: `.config(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", \"50\")` (or lower, e.g., 10 or 20 for Colab). Too many partitions can cause memory overhead per partition.

**Let's try a combination of Strategy 1 and being more careful with DataFrame references.**
The `df` variable is being transformed step-by-step. The final selection `final_classified_abt_df = df.select(cols_to_select_ordered)` creates the DataFrame with the desired final schema. It's this `final_classified_abt_df` that we try to persist and count.

**Revised Cell 13 - Attempt 1 (No persist before count):**

**Explanation of Changes in this \"Attempt 1\":**

1.  **Input DataFrame Renamed:** `abt_df_for_classification` is renamed to `abt_df_input_for_class` for clarity that it's the input.
2.  **Input DataFrame Persisted and Counted Early:**
    *   `abt_df_input_for_class.persist()`
    *   `initial_count_for_class_cell = abt_df_input_for_class.count()`
    *   This is to ensure the DataFrame read from disk is materialized in memory *before* we start the chain of transformations. If this step itself causes OOM, then the ABT from Cell 12 is already too large for Colab to comfortably work with even for a read and cache.
3.  **Transformations on `df_transformed`:** A new variable `df_transformed` is created, starting as `abt_df_input_for_class`, and all subsequent `withColumn` operations update `df_transformed`. This keeps the lineage tied to `df_transformed`.
4.  **Final Selection:** The `final_classified_abt_df` is created by selecting only the necessary columns from `df_transformed`.
5.  **NO `.persist()` on `final_classified_abt_df`:** The line `final_classified_abt_df.persist()` is commented out.
6.  **Actions:** The `.count()` and `.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(output_path_parquet)` are the main actions on `final_classified_abt_df`. Spark will compute the necessary transformations to perform these actions.

**Before Running This:**

*   **Restart Kernel:** Highly recommended to get a fresh memory state.
*   **Re-run Cells 1, 2, 3:** To load master data and initialize Spark.
*   **Ensure `output_path_parquet` (from Cell 12) exists and is correct.** The first thing this Cell 13 does is read it.

This approach tries to minimize the memory footprint by not explicitly caching the very wide `final_classified_abt_df` before writing. If this still fails with OOM, it strongly suggests the resulting DataFrame (with ~90+ columns and 33M rows) is simply too big for the available memory in your Colab runtime when Spark tries to execute the plan for the `count` or `write` action. In that case, more drastic measures like processing in client batches or moving to a more powerful Spark environment might be needed for this final classification step."""),

This sequence of errors at the very beginning of Cell 13, specifically when trying to execute `spark.read.parquet(output_path_parquet)`, indicates a severe problem with the SparkSession or its connection to the underlying JVM (Java Virtual Machine) where Spark actually runs.

**What this usually means in Colab:**

1.  **SparkSession Has Died/Crashed:** The most common reason. The Spark context that was initialized in Cell 1 is no longer running or responsive. This could be due to:
    *   **Colab Inactivity Timeout:** If there was a long pause between running previous cells and this one, Colab might have idled the backend.
    *   **Previous OOM or Resource Exhaustion:** Even if a previous cell *appeared* to complete, it might have left the Spark environment in an unstable state or used up too many resources, leading to a silent crash of the Spark components before Cell 13 started. The OOM errors we saw earlier are strong indicators of resource pressure.
    *   **Colab Resource Limits Hit:** Colab might have proactively killed the Spark backend processes if they were consuming too many resources (CPU/RAM) for too long.

2.  **Py4J Bridge Failure:** The Py4J library is what allows Python to communicate with Spark's JVM. If this bridge breaks for any reason (often tied to the Spark context dying), you'll get network-like errors.

**The error \"Answer from Java side is empty\" is a strong sign that the Python side sent a command (like \"read this Parquet file\") but the Java side (Spark engine) didn't reply, likely because it's not running or can't process the request.**

**Immediate Steps to Try:**

1.  **Restart the Colab Runtime/Kernel:** This is almost always the first thing to do for such errors.
    *   Go to \"Runtime\" -> \"Restart runtime...\"
    *   Confirm the restart.

2.  **Re-run from the Beginning of the Notebook, Sequentially:**
    *   **Cell 1 (Setup):** Crucial to initialize a fresh, healthy SparkSession and mount Drive.
    *   **Cell 2 (Data Loading Functions):** Define helpers.
    *   **Cell 3 (Load All Raw Data):** Load and persist your master DataFrames. **Monitor this cell closely.** If it completes successfully with all master DFs persisted, that's a good sign.
    *   **Cell 4 (Snapshot Date Generation):**
    *   **Cell 5 (Client-Snapshot Base & Initial Write to `temp_abt_path`):** This is the first write to disk.
    *   **Cell 6 (Recency & Write to `temp_abt_path`):**
    *   **Cell 7 (Freq/Monetary & Write to `temp_abt_path`):** This was the very long cell.
    *   **Cell 8 (Funding/AUM & Write to `temp_abt_path`):**
    *   **Cell 9 (Payout Risk & Write to `temp_abt_path`):**
    *   **Cell 10 (Deltas & Write to `temp_abt_path`):**
    *   **Cell 11 (Churn Labels & Write to `temp_abt_path`):**
    *   **Cell 12 (Final Filtering & Write to *`output_path_parquet`*):** This is the cell that creates the file Cell 13 is trying to read.
    *   **Then, try Cell 13 again.**

**Why a full re-run (up to Cell 12) might be necessary after a restart:**

*   The `temp_abt_path` and `output_path_parquet` files on your Drive are persistent. So, if Cells 5-12 *did* complete successfully before the Spark context died, the data is there.
*   However, all the **master DataFrames** (`trades_master_df`, `logins_master_df`, etc.) that were loaded and persisted in Cell 3 are **lost from memory** after a kernel restart. Cell 11 (Churn Labels) and potentially other cells might still need these if they perform joins against them (Cell 11 definitely does for Condition B).
*   Even if Cell 12 wrote the final ABT correctly, if the Spark session is dead when Cell 13 starts, it can't even initiate the `spark.read.parquet()` command.

**If you suspect Cells 5-12 *did* complete and write their respective outputs successfully before the previous crash:**

*   After restarting the kernel:
    *   Run Cell 1 (Setup).
    *   Run Cell 2 (Define loading functions).
    *   Run Cell 3 (Load and persist ALL master DataFrames).
    *   *Then* try running Cell 13. Cell 13 reads from `output_path_parquet`, which should be the result of Cell 12.

**If OOM errors were a persistent problem leading up to this:**

*   The \"iterative write to disk\" strategy is good, but if the ABT becomes extremely wide (many columns) AND has many rows (33M), even reading and then performing the transformations in Cell 13 (which adds more columns before the final selection) on a DataFrame of that size might be too much for Colab's default RAM.
*   **Consider a Higher RAM Runtime:** If you're on the free tier of Colab, and these OOMs or connection errors persist after restarts, you might be hitting the limits of that environment. Upgrading to Colab Pro (which offers more RAM) could be beneficial for such large-scale Spark jobs.
*   **Further Reduce DataFrame Width in Cell 13 (if possible):** If there are any intermediate columns created *within* Cell 13's Excel logic that can be dropped *before* the final selection that creates `final_classified_abt_df`, do so. However, Cell 13 is already trying to be lean by building up `df_transformed` and then doing a final `select`.

Start with the kernel restart and re-running Cells 1, 2, and 3. Then try Cell 13. If the `spark.read.parquet()` in Cell 13 still fails with a connection error, the SparkSession isn't stable even after a fresh start, which might point to very fundamental resource constraints when trying to operate on the ABT from Cell 12."""),

**Key Success Points:**

1.  **Successful Read:** `Read final ABT ... with 33,197,513 rows.` - It correctly read the output from Cell 12.
2.  **Successful Count & Persist:** `Successfully read and count verified for input ABT: 33197513 rows.` - The initial persist and count on the input DataFrame for Cell 13 worked, indicating the Spark session was healthy and could handle the DataFrame read from disk.
3.  **Calculations Completed:** The dynamic status score and all the Excel-based classification logic ran without OOM or other errors.
4.  **Sample Output Looks Correct:**
    *   The sample shows the `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` being 100.0 when `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` is 0.
    *   `Historical_Total_Score` and `Historical_Tag` are populated. For the client \"A\\*\" who has `Last_Trade_Date` as NULL and likely low activity scores, a `Historical_Total_Score` of 100 and `Historical_Tag` of \"Classic\" seems plausible (as their `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic` contributes 100, and other scores might be low or zero).
5.  **Final ABT Dimensions:** `Final ABT with classification has 33197513 rows and 94 columns.`
    *   The row count is consistent.
    *   The column count increased from 91 (after Cell 12) to 94. The 3 new columns are `Excel_Status_Score_S_Dynamic`, `Historical_Total_Score`, and `Historical_Tag`, which is exactly what we intended to add.
6.  **Successful Write:** `Overwriting final ABT ... Final ABT with classification features successfully saved.` - The fully enriched ABT is now saved to its final destination.

**Congratulations! This completes the entire ABT generation process.** You now have a very comprehensive ABT with:
*   Base client and snapshot information
*   Tenure
*   A rich set of recency, frequency, and monetary features for trades, logins, deposits, and payouts across multiple lookbacks
*   Funding flow features
*   AUM features
*   Payout risk features
*   Delta (trend) features
*   Four distinct churn labels (`Is_Churned_Engage_...Days`)
*   The Excel-based classification (`Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Tag`) for analytical purposes.

This is a significant achievement, especially navigating the memory constraints of the environment. The iterative disk-writing strategy for the main feature blocks and careful handling of the final classification step paid off.

**Yes, let's move on to modeling!**

We will now switch to the `Churn_Modeling.ipynb` notebook.
The first steps there will be:
1.  Setup SparkSession.
2.  Load the final ABT from `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet`.
3.  Basic exploration of the ABT (schema, nulls, describe).
4.  Select a target variable (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`).
5.  Define feature columns.
6.  Perform the time-based train/test split.

**Explanation and Next Steps:**

*   **Cell 1:** Standard setup for a modeling notebook.
*   **Cell 2:** Loads the final ABT from Parquet. It's crucial this path is correct. Persists it for initial explorations. Shows schema and sample data.
*   **Cell 3:**
    *   `TARGET_COL`: **You'll need to choose which churn label to model first.** I've put `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` as an example.
    *   **Feature Selection:** It defines `excluded_cols_for_features` to remove keys, other target labels, raw date columns (like `Last_Trade_Date` - we use `Days_Since_Last_Trade` instead), and the descriptive classification tags. `feature_columns` is then derived. Review this list carefully to ensure it makes sense.
*   **Cell 4:**
    *   **Time-Based Split:** Implements a split based on `SnapshotDate`. I've used a fixed `SPLIT_DATE_STR = \"2023-03-01\"`. This means:
        *   Training data will include snapshots up to `2023-02-28`.
        *   Test data will include snapshots from `2023-03-31` onwards (which is `2023-03-31` and `2023-04-30` given our ABT).
        *   This aligns with your idea of making predictions for March 2023 snapshots and validating them.
    *   The train and test sets are persisted.

**Before Running:**

1.  **Kernel Restart (if needed):** If the kernel from ABT generation was stopped or unstable, restart it.
2.  **Run Cell 1 (Setup):** Ensure SparkSession initializes and paths are correct.
3.  **Run Cell 2 (Load ABT):** Verify it loads your ABT successfully. Check the row/column count.
4.  **Run Cell 3 (Target & Features):**
    *   **Modify `TARGET_COL`** if you want to start with a different churn window.
    *   **Carefully review `excluded_cols_for_features` and the resulting `feature_columns` list.** Ensure it includes all relevant numeric features and excludes things that would cause leakage or aren't direct model inputs.
5.  **Run Cell 4 (Split):** Check the train/test counts and date ranges to ensure the split happened as expected.

Once these four cells are run successfully, `train_df` and `test_df` will be ready, and we can proceed to build the ML pipeline (VectorAssembler, StandardScaler, Model)."""),

    ```python

    ```
2.  **Re-run Cell 1.**
3.  **Re-run Cell 2 and Cell 3** to ensure `abt_df` and `feature_columns` are correctly defined in the current session scope.
4.  **Then, re-run the corrected Cell 4.**

The explicit import of `DateType` (either in Cell 1 globally, or locally in Cell 4 as a fallback) should resolve the `NameError`. I've also made the check for `train_count + test_count` slightly more robust in case `abt_df` was unpersisted."""),

*   **`feature_columns` and `TARGET_COL` (defined in Cell 3) should still be Python variables in your kernel's memory.**

**In this specific case (NameError for `DateType` in Cell 4):**

You *must* re-run Cells 1, 2, and 3 to re-initialize Spark, reload the ABT into `abt_df` and persist it, and redefine `feature_columns`.
*   **If `abt_df` was explicitly unpersisted:** If a cell *after* Cell 2 explicitly called `abt_df.unpersist()` and you need `abt_df` again for a subsequent cell like Cell 4, you'd need to re-load it (effectively re-running Cell 2, or at least the `spark.read.parquet` and `persist` part). Our current Cell 4 logic includes an unpersist for `abt_df` *at its end*, meaning if you re-run Cell 4 multiple times, it would expect `abt_df` to be available at its start.
*   **If you change the ABT file itself:** If you re-generate the ABT (e.g., run `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` again), you must re-run Cell 2 to load the new version.
*   **If you change `TARGET_COL` or `excluded_cols_for_features` in Cell 3:** You must re-run Cell 3 to update the `feature_columns` list.

**For your current situation (fixing the `NameError: name 'DateType' is not defined` in Cell 4):**
Yes, you can likely get away with just:
1. Correcting and re-running Cell 1.
2. Re-running Cell 4.

This assumes `abt_df` from Cell 2 is still validly cached and `feature_columns` from Cell 3 is still a defined Python variable. You can quickly verify this by inserting a temporary cell before re-running Cell 4 and doing:
```python
print('abt_df' in locals() and abt_df.is_cached)
print('feature_columns' in locals() and len(feature_columns) > 0)
```
If both print `True`, you are good to go with just re-running Cell 1 and then Cell 4."""),

In the provided code for **Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection and Feature Definition)**, I used:
```python
TARGET_COL = \"Is_Churned_Engage_270Days\" # Example: Starting with 270-day churn
```
as an **example** and a **starting point**.

**The Rationale:**

1.  **Iterative Modeling:** When building multiple models for different prediction windows (60D, 90D, 270D, 365D), it's standard practice to work through the modeling pipeline (data prep, train, eval, tune) for *one target variable at a time*.
    *   Trying to build and manage four separate model pipelines simultaneously in the same notebook flow can become very messy and hard to track.
2.  **Focus:** Selecting one target allows us to focus on:
    *   Ensuring the feature selection for that target is correct.
    *   Evaluating model performance specifically for that prediction window.
    *   Understanding feature importances for that specific churn definition.
3.  **270-Day as a Balanced Starting Point (Example Choice):**
    *   **Shorter windows (60D, 90D):** Might have more churn events (as seen in our EDA), potentially leading to more balanced classes or easier initial modeling. However, the business impact of predicting very short-term churn might be different.
    *   **Longest window (365D):** Represents a very definitive churn but might have fewer positive instances, potentially leading to more severe class imbalance. The prediction is also further out, which can sometimes be harder.
    *   **270-Day:** Was chosen as a somewhat intermediate, longer-term window that still represents significant churn. It's often a good balance.

**The Plan Was Always to Iterate:**

The intention, as outlined in the overall project goals and our previous discussions, is to:
1.  Build and evaluate a model for one target (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`).
2.  **Then, repeat the modeling process** (from feature preparation with the new target, splitting, training, evaluation, tuning) for the other target variables:
    *   `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`
    *   `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`
    *   `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`

**How Cell 3 Facilitates This Iteration:**

*   **`TARGET_COL` Variable:** This variable is defined at the top of Cell 3. To switch to modeling a different churn window, you would simply **change the string assigned to `TARGET_COL`** in Cell 3 and then re-run Cell 3 and all subsequent modeling cells (Cell 4 for splitting, Cell 5 for pipeline, etc.).
    ```python
    # To model 90-day churn next:
    TARGET_COL = \"Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\" 
    # Then re-run Cell 3, Cell 4, Cell 5, etc.
    ```
*   **Dynamic Feature Exclusion:** The `feature_columns` list is created by excluding the *currently selected* `TARGET_COL` and all *other* churn labels. This ensures that for each modeling iteration, only the relevant target is used as the label, and other potential future churn labels are not accidentally included as features (which would be data leakage).

**In summary:** We picked `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` in Cell 3 just to start the modeling workflow for one specific case. The notebook is designed so you can easily change `TARGET_COL` and re-run the subsequent cells to build models for each of your desired churn prediction windows. We are not limited to only the 270-day model."""),

Okay, we've encountered the `OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` again, this time in **Cell 4 (Data Splitting)**, specifically when trying to execute `train_df.count()` (or `test_df.count()`).

This is happening because the actions `train_df.persist()` and `test_df.persist()`, followed by `train_df.count()` and `test_df.count()`, are trying to materialize and cache these two (potentially large) DataFrames in memory.

*   `abt_df` (loaded in Cell 2) has ~33 million rows and ~91-94 columns.
*   `train_df` will be a large fraction of this (e.g., ~26-28 million rows if `SPLIT_DATE_STR = \"2023-03-01\"`).
*   `test_df` will be the remainder (e.g., ~5-7 million rows).

Even though we are splitting `abt_df`, trying to hold both `train_df` and `test_df` in memory simultaneously via `.persist()` (especially if `abt_df` itself was still partially cached or its lineage was complex before unpersisting) is exceeding Colab's memory limits.

The traceback involving `InMemoryRelation`, `CachedRDDBuilder`, and `MemoryStore` confirms that this is an OOM during the caching/materialization process.

**Strategy to Mitigate OOM in Cell 4 (Data Splitting):**

We need to avoid trying to cache both `train_df` and `test_df` in memory at the same time if the source `abt_df` is very large. The \"iterative write to disk\" strategy can be adapted here as well for the train and test sets if necessary, or we can be more careful with `persist()` and actions.

**Option 1: Remove `persist()` for `train_df` and `test_df` before initial count (and potentially write them to disk if they will be reused many times).**
   If you are going to immediately use `train_df` and `test_df` in the next cell for pipeline fitting and evaluation, *not* persisting them might be okay for a one-time use. However, model training and evaluation often involve multiple passes over the data, so persisting is generally good if it fits. Since it's not fitting, we need another approach.

**Option 2: Persist, Count, and Unpersist one by one, or Write to Disk (Recommended)**
   This is similar to our ABT generation strategy.

   *   Create `train_df`, persist it, count it, **write it to a temporary Parquet file**, then unpersist it.
   *   Create `test_df`, persist it, count it, **write it to a temporary Parquet file**, then unpersist it.
   *   In subsequent cells (e.g., Cell 5 for pipeline building), you would then *read* `train_df` and `test_df` from these Parquet files.

This is the most robust way to handle large train/test sets in a memory-constrained environment.

**Key Changes in this Revised Cell 4:**

1.  **Define `train_df_path` and `test_df_path`:** Specifies where the train and test Parquet files will be saved.
2.  **Process `train_df` First:**
    *   Filters to create `train_df`.
    *   Persists `train_df`, gets its count.
    *   Writes `train_df` to `train_df_path` using `mode(\"overwrite\")`.
    *   Unpersists `train_df` from memory.
3.  **Process `test_df` Second:**
    *   Filters to create `test_df`.
    *   Persists `test_df`, gets its count.
    *   Writes `test_df` to `test_df_path` using `mode(\"overwrite\")`.
    *   Unpersists `test_df` from memory.
4.  **Final Unpersist of `abt_df`:** After both train and test are safely on disk, the original `abt_df` (loaded in Cell 2) is unpersisted.
5.  **More Robust Count Check:** The percentage calculation and sum check is made more aware of whether the original `abt_df` is still cached.

**How Subsequent Cells Will Use This:**

*   **Cell 5 (Pipeline Definition):** Will start by reading `train_df` and `test_df` from their Parquet paths:
    ```python
    # At the beginning of Cell 5
    print(\"Loading train and test data from disk...\")
    train_df = spark.read.parquet(train_df_path)
    test_df = spark.read.parquet(test_df_path)
    
    train_df.persist() # Persist for pipeline fitting and evaluation
    test_df.persist()  # Persist for evaluation
    
    print(f\"Loaded train_df with {train_df.count()} rows.\")
    print(f\"Loaded test_df with {test_df.count()} rows.\")
    ```

**Before Running This Revised Cell 4:**

*   **Ensure Cell 1 (Setup) has been run** in the current session (for `DateType` and other imports).
*   **Ensure Cell 2 (Load ABT) has been run** and `abt_df` is loaded and persisted successfully.
*   **Ensure Cell 3 (Target & Features) has been run** so `TARGET_COL` and `feature_columns` are defined (though Cell 4 doesn't directly use `feature_columns`, subsequent cells will).

This approach makes Cell 4 more memory-robust. It will be slower due to disk I/O, but successful completion is the priority."""),

This is the same `ConnectionRefusedError` pattern we saw before, manifesting as a `Py4JError` during a Spark action (`.count()`). It's happening right at the beginning of the `if 'abt_df' in locals() and abt_df.is_cached:` block in Cell 4, when it tries to get the count of the `abt_df` loaded in Cell 2.

This strongly indicates that **the SparkSession or its JVM backend became unstable or crashed *after* Cell 3 completed (or during Cell 3 if it was very heavy) but *before* Cell 4 could successfully execute its first Spark action.**

Even though Cell 2 (loading `abt_df` and persisting it) and Cell 3 (defining `TARGET_COL` and `feature_columns`) might have printed \"success\" messages, the Spark context seems to have been lost by the time Cell 4's `abt_df.count()` was called.

**This is a common frustration in resource-constrained environments like the free tier of Colab when dealing with large DataFrames.** The `persist()` in Cell 2 attempts to cache `abt_df` (33M rows, 90+ columns), which is a very large object. While the persist itself might not throw an immediate OOM, it puts immense pressure on the system, and the context can die shortly after, or when the next significant action is requested.

**What to do now:**

1.  **Restart the Colab Runtime/Kernel:** This is essential to get a fresh SparkSession.
    *   \"Runtime\" -> \"Restart runtime...\"

2.  **Re-run Cells Sequentially, with an eye on memory for `abt_df` in Cell 2:**
    *   **Cell 1 (Setup):** Re-initialize Spark. Consider reducing `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` here if you haven't already, as a trial. For example:
        ```python
        spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"ReligareChurnModeling\") \\
            .config(\"spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy\", \"LEGACY\") \\
            .config(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", \"20\") # Try a much smaller number for Colab
            .config(\"spark.driver.memory\", \"4g\") # Attempt to request more driver memory (may or may not be fully honored in Colab free tier)
            .config(\"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\", \"true\") \\
            .getOrCreate()
        ```
        *(Note: `spark.driver.memory` setting might have limited effect in Colab's standard environment but doesn't hurt to try.)*
    *   **Cell 2 (Load ABT and Initial Exploration):** This is the critical cell.
        *   When it loads `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)`, this is fine.
        *   The line `abt_df.persist()` is where the problem likely starts if `abt_df` is too big for memory.
        *   **Modification for Cell 2 (Strategy: Don't persist the full ABT if it's causing crashes):**
            If `abt_df` is simply too large to reliably persist in Colab's memory, we must avoid persisting the *entire thing* before splitting. The strategy in the \"Revised Cell 4\" (writing `train_df` and `test_df` to disk) is designed to work even if the source `abt_df` isn't fully cached, as Spark will read what it needs from disk for the filters.
            ```python
            # In Cell 2:
            print(f\"\\nLoading ABT from: {abt_path}\")
            abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)
            # abt_df.persist() # <<--- COMMENT THIS OUT or REMOVE IT for now
            
            # Perform a less memory-intensive action just to verify it loaded
            print(f\"ABT loaded. Verifying with a sample. First 5 rows, 5 columns:\")
            abt_df.select(abt_df.columns[:5]).show(5)
            print(f\"ABT has {len(abt_df.columns)} columns.\")
            # We can't reliably get .count() here if persist is an issue.
            # We'll get counts after splitting in Cell 4.
            
            print(\"\\nABT Schema:\")
            abt_df.printSchema()
            # ... rest of Cell 2's exploration (describe can also be heavy)
            ```
    *   **Cell 3 (Target & Features):** Run this as it defines Python variables. It doesn't perform heavy Spark actions.
    *   **Cell 4 (Revised Cell 4 - with writing train/test to disk):** Now, when Cell 4 runs:
        *   The `if 'abt_df' in locals() and abt_df.is_cached:` condition at the start will be `False` (because we didn't persist in Cell 2, so `is_cached` is false).
        *   We need to adjust the start of Cell 4 to just check `if 'abt_df' in locals():`
        *   The `abt_df.filter(...)` operations to create `train_df` and `test_df` will read from the `abt_df` DataFrame object (which internally knows to read from the Parquet file on disk as needed).
        *   The subsequent `train_df.persist()`, `train_df.count()`, `train_df.write...` (and same for `test_df`) will then operate on these *smaller, filtered* DataFrames, which have a much better chance of fitting in memory for caching and writing.

**Plan:**
1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Run Corrected Cell 1** (with reduced `shuffle.partitions` and potentially `driver.memory` attempt).
3.  **Run Revised Cell 2** (which does *not* persist the full `abt_df`). Verify it prints the schema and sample.
4.  **Run Cell 3** (defines `TARGET_COL`, `feature_columns`).
5.  **Run this latest Revised Cell 4.** This version doesn't rely on `abt_df.is_cached` at the start and attempts to persist/count/write the smaller `train_df` and `test_df` segments individually.

This strategy aims to avoid holding the entire massive ABT in cached memory before the split. The filters for `train_df` and `test_df` will read from disk as needed, and then we only try to cache and process these smaller, filtered pieces."""),

Here's how that would work:

1.  **Cell 4 Successful Completion:**
    *   `train_df` is created, its count is obtained, and it's written to `train_df_path` (e.g., `.../model_data_temp/train_df.parquet`).
    *   `test_df` is created, its count is obtained, and it's written to `test_df_path` (e.g., `.../model_data_temp/test_df.parquet`).
    *   The print messages confirm these writes.

2.  **Session Stops (e.g., timeout, crash, manual restart):**
    *   All in-memory Python variables and Spark DataFrame objects (including any that were `.persist()`ed) are lost.
    *   However, the Parquet files `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` **remain on your Google Drive.**

3.  **Resuming Work (to start with Cell 5 - ML Pipeline):**
    *   **Restart Kernel** if it hasn't been done automatically.
    *   **Run Cell 1 (Setup):**
        *   Re-initializes SparkSession.
        *   Re-mounts Google Drive.
        *   Defines all paths, including `train_df_path` and `test_df_path`.
        *   Defines constants.
    *   **Run Cell 2 (Load ABT and Initial Exploration):**
        *   This cell loads the *full* `abt_df` using `spark.read.parquet(abt_path)`.
        *   **Important:** In the \"Revised Cell 2\" we discussed, we *removed* `abt_df.persist()`. This is good because we don't actually need the full `abt_df` in memory if `train_df` and `test_df` are already saved.
        *   So, Cell 2 will just define `abt_df` as a DataFrame objectYes, if the **Revised Cell 4 (the one that writes `train_df. pointing to the full ABT on disk. You can even comment out the `abt_df.select(...).show()`parquet` and `test_df.parquet` to disk)** completes successfully, you achieve a very good checkpoint.

** and `abt_df.printSchema()` if you don't need to see them again, to make Cell 2 runIf Cell 4 completes and writes both Parquet files to your Google Drive:**

1.  `train_df.parquet` exists on Drive.
2.  `test_df.parquet` exists on Drive.

**Then faster. The main thing is that `abt_df` as a variable is defined if Cell 3 needs its schema for, if the Colab session stops (or you manually stop it) after Cell 4:**

**To Resume:**

1. `feature_columns` (though Cell 3 could also get schema from `train_df` or `test_df`).
    *   **Run Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection and Feature Definition):**
        *   This  **Restart Kernel (if it stopped or you want a fresh start).**
2.  **Run Cell 1 ( cell redefines `TARGET_COL` and, critically, the `feature_columns` list. The `feature_columnsSetup):** To initialize SparkSession, mount Drive, define paths (including `train_df_path` and `test_` list is derived from `abt_df.columns`. So, `abt_df` must be defined (even if notdf_path`).
3.  **Run Cell 2 (Data Loading Functions):** Only if subsequent cells might persisted) from Cell 2 for Cell 3 to work.
    *   **SKIP Cell 4 (Data Splitting): *unexpectedly* need to reload master data for some ad-hoc check.

**Key Successes and Observations:**

1.  **Correct Source ABT:** `Source ABT for splitting is available (schema has 94 columns).` - It correctly identified the ABT from Cell 2/3.
2.  **Split Logic Applied:** `Splitting data using SnapshotDate. Training data: before 2023-03-01` - The split date was correctly used.
3.  **Training Data Processed:**
    *   `Training data: 30,671,842 rows` - This is the count for snapshots before March 2023.
    *   `Writing Training data to: .../train_df.parquet` - Successfully written.
    *   `SnapshotDate range in Training Data: 2021-01-31 to 2023-02-28` - This range is correct.
    *   `Unpersisted train_df from memory.` - Good memory management.
4.  **Test Data Processed:**
    *   `Test data: 2,525,671 rows` - This is the count for snapshots from March 2023 onwards.
    *   `Writing Test data to: .../test_df.parquet` - Successfully written.
    *   `SnapshotDate range in Test Data: 2023-03-31 to 2023-04-30` - This range is correct (covering the March and April 2023 snapshots from your ABT).
    *   `Unpersisted test_df from memory.` - Good memory management.
5.  **Split Summary:**
    *   `Training data: 30,671,842 rows (92.39%)`
    *   `Test data: 2,525,671 rows (7.61%)`
    *   The percentages make sense given the `SPLIT_DATE_STR = \"2023-03-01\"` and the ABT's snapshot range of Jan 2021 to Apr 2023. The split is roughly 26 months for train (Jan'21-Feb'23) vs. 2 months for test (Mar'23-Apr'23).
6.  **Successful Completion:** `Train/Test split and writing to disk successful.`

**Key Successes:**

1.  **Successful Data Loading:**
    *   `Loading training data from: .../train_df.parquet`
    *   `Loading test data from: .../test_df.parquet`
    *   `Successfully loaded train_df with 30,671,842 rows.`
    *   `Successfully loaded test_df with 2,525,671 rows.`
    *   This confirms that the train and test DataFrames written to disk by Cell 4 were correctly read back into Spark. The row counts match the output of Cell 4.
    *   The `persist()` calls on `train_df` and `test_df` after loading will help speed up the subsequent model training and evaluation steps.

2.  **Target and Feature Confirmation:**
    *   `Using TARGET_COL: Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` - Confirms the target variable we set in Cell 3.
    *   `Number of features to assemble: 78` - This tells us that after excluding keys, other targets, and descriptive columns, we have 78 features remaining to feed into the model. This is a good number of features. (The ABT had 94 columns, so 94 - 1 (target) - 15 (approx excluded like keys, other labels, excel tags) = 78, which seems consistent).

3.  **Pipeline Definition:**
    *   `ML Pipeline defined with Assembler, Scaler, and Logistic Regression.` - The initial pipeline structure is ready.
        *   `VectorAssembler` will combine the 78 feature columns. `handleInvalid=\"skip\"` is a crucial setting.
        *   `StandardScaler` will scale these features.
        *   `LogisticRegression` is set up as our first model.

**Next Steps: Cell 6 - Model Training and Initial Evaluation**

We are now ready to train this pipeline on `train_df` and then use the trained model to make predictions on `test_df` for an initial evaluation. We also need to consider class imbalance for Logistic Regression.

Let's proceed to Cell 6.

**Explanation of Cell 6:**

1.  **Check Class Imbalance:**
    *   It first groups `train_df` by the `TARGET_COL` and counts instances to understand the class distribution. This is crucial for churn prediction, which is often imbalanced.
2.  **Calculate Class Weights (for Logistic Regression):**
    *   If imbalanced, it calculates weights to give more importance to the minority class. The formula `N / (2 * N_k)` (where N is total samples, N\\_k is samples in class k) is a common way to derive these.
    *   A new column `classWeightCol` is added to `train_df_weighted`.
    *   The `LogisticRegression` stage in the `pipeline` is updated to use this `weightCol`.
3.  **Fit Pipeline:**
    *   `pipeline_model = pipeline.fit(train_df_weighted)` (or `train_df` if no weighting was applied). This trains the assembler, scaler, and the logistic regression model.
4.  **Make Predictions:**
    *   `predictions_lr = pipeline_model.transform(test_df)` applies the trained pipeline to the test set. This will add `rawFeatures`, `scaledFeatures`, `probability` (vector of [P(0), P(1)]), and `prediction` (0 or 1) columns.
5.  **Evaluate Model:**
    *   **AUC-ROC and AUC-PR:** `BinaryClassificationEvaluator` is used. AUC-PR is often more informative for imbalanced datasets.
    *   **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1:** `MulticlassClassificationEvaluator` (which works for binary too) is used to get these metrics based on the hard `prediction` column. \"Weighted\" versions are used to account for class imbalance in the metrics themselves.
    *   **Confusion Matrix:** A simple `groupBy().count()` on the `TARGET_COL` and `prediction` columns from `predictions_lr` gives the TP, TN, FP, FN counts.

**Before Running Cell 6:**

*   Ensure Cell 5 has completed successfully, and `pipeline`, `train_df`, and `test_df` are defined and cached.
*   The class weighting logic assumes your `TARGET_COL` contains 0s and 1s.

This cell will give you the first set of performance results for your churn prediction task using a Logistic Regression model. The metrics will establish a baseline. Next, we'll try Random Forest."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""This output from Cell 6 (Logistic Regression) is excellent! It shows the model has trained, made predictions, and we have a first set of evaluation metrics.

Let's analyze the results:

**Analysis of Logistic Regression Results:**

1.  **Class Imbalance:**
    *   `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days = 1 (Churned): 1,331,711`
    *   `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days = 0 (Not Churned): 29,340,131`
    *   This is a significant imbalance (approx 1:22).
    *   The calculated `Balancing Ratios` (`Class 0: 0.5227, Class 1: 11.5160`) correctly reflect this, giving much higher weight to the minority class (churned=1). Using `classWeightCol` was the right approach.

2.  **Predictions Sample:**
    *   The `probability` column shows two values: `[P(class=0), P(class=1)]`.
    *   The `prediction` column is 0.0 or 1.0 based on which probability is higher (default threshold 0.5).
    *   The sample shows high P(class=0) for instances where the actual label is 0, which is good.

3.  **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **AUC-ROC: 0.9228:** This is a very good AUC-ROC score. It indicates that the model has a strong ability to discriminate between the churned and not-churned classes. A value close to 1 is excellent.
    *   **AUC-PR: 0.1929:** The Area Under the Precision-Recall curve. For highly imbalanced datasets, AUC-PR is often a more informative metric than AUC-ROC. A score of 0.19 is modest. The baseline for AUC-PR is the proportion of the positive class (churners), which is roughly `1.3M / 30.6M approx = 0.043`. So, 0.19 is significantly better than random guessing, but there's room for improvement in precision/recall balance for the positive class.
    *   **Accuracy: 0.7786:** The model correctly classifies about 77.86% of the instances in the test set. However, with imbalance, accuracy can be misleading (a model predicting all as \"not churned\" would still have high accuracy).
    *   **Weighted Precision: 0.9714:** This is very high. It suggests that when the model predicts a class, it's often correct, weighted by class support.
    *   **Weighted Recall: 0.7786:** This matches the accuracy.
    *   **F1 Score: 0.8505:** This is the weighted F1 score, which is a good overall measure.

4.  **Confusion Matrix:**
    *   `Actual 0, Predicted 0 (TN): 1,888,985` (Correctly identified non-churners)
    *   `Actual 0, Predicted 1 (FP): 557,246` (Non-churners incorrectly flagged as churners - False Positives)
    *   `Actual 1, Predicted 0 (FN): 2,007` (Churners missed by the model - False Negatives)
    *   `Actual 1, Predicted 1 (TP): 77,433` (Correctly identified churners - True Positives)

    *   **From the Confusion Matrix, we can calculate specific recall and precision for the churn class (class 1):**
        *   **Recall for Churners (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate):** TP / (TP + FN) = 77433 / (77433 + 2007) = 77433 / 79440 = **0.9747 (or 97.47%)**
            *   This is extremely high! The model (with class weighting) is identifying almost all of the actual churners.
        *   **Precision for Churners:** TP / (TP + FP) = 77433 / (77433 + 557246) = 77433 / 634679 = **0.1220 (or 12.20%)**
            *   This is low. It means that when the model predicts a client will churn, only about 12.2% of those predictions are actually correct. Many non-churners are being flagged as churners.

**Interpretation of LR Performance:**

*   The model is excellent at **finding almost all the true churners** (very high recall for class 1). This is likely due to the aggressive class weighting.
*   However, this comes at the cost of **low precision for the churn class**, meaning it generates a lot of false positives (flags many non-churners as churners).
*   The AUC-ROC is good, but the AUC-PR highlights the precision/recall trade-off for the positive class.

This is a common outcome when heavily weighting the minority class. For a churn problem, high recall for churners is often desired (you don't want to miss them), but the business cost of false positives (e.g., unnecessarily giving retention offers to non-churners) needs to be considered.

**Yes, the results are definitely \"ok\" for a first model and a good baseline!** We now have a benchmark. Random Forest might offer better precision.

**Key aspects of Cell 7 (Random Forest):**

1.  **Pipeline Reuse:** It reuses the `assembler` and `scaler` stages from the previous pipeline.
2.  **RandomForestClassifier:**
    *   Initialized with `numTrees=100` (more than default for potentially better performance) and a `seed` for reproducibility.
    *   **Class Weights:** I've included commented-out code to show how you *could* use `classWeightCol` with Random Forest if you find it necessary. For the first run, it uses the original `train_df` without explicit weights to see how RF handles imbalance by default. Tree-based ensembles can sometimes be less sensitive or have other parameters (like `minInstancesPerNode` or tree depth) that help.
3.  **Evaluation:** The same set of evaluation metrics is calculated for Random Forest, allowing for direct comparison with Logistic Regression.
4.  **Specific Class 1 Metrics:** Added explicit calculation for Precision and Recall for the churner class (class 1) from the confusion matrix components, as these are often the most critical for business interpretation.

Run this Cell 7. It will take longer than Logistic Regression due to `numTrees=100`. We're looking to see if AUC-PR improves and if the precision for the churner class gets better, hopefully without sacrificing too much recall."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Yes, we have taken a specific step to address the class imbalance, particularly for the Logistic Regression model, and we have the option to do so for Random Forest as well.

Here's a breakdown of how class imbalance is being handled or considered:

**1. For Logistic Regression (in Cell 6):**

*   **`classWeightCol`:** This was the primary method used.
    *   We calculated the distribution of the target variable in the training set (`train_df`).
    *   Based on this distribution, we computed weights for each class (0 and 1) using the formula: `Weight_k = TotalSamples / (2 * SamplesInClass_k)`.
        *   This gives a higher weight to the minority class (churners = 1) and a lower weight to the majority class (non-churners = 0).
        *   For your data: `Balancing Ratios - Class 0: 0.5227, Class 1: 11.5160`. Class 1 (churners) instances are weighted ~22 times more heavily than Class 0 instances.
    *   A new column named `\"classWeightCol\"` was added to `train_df` (creating `train_df_weighted`).
    *   The `LogisticRegression` model was explicitly told to use these weights during training: `lr_model_stage.setWeightCol(\"classWeightCol\")`.
*   **Effect:** This method makes the model pay much more attention to misclassifying instances from the minority class. As we saw, this led to very high recall for churners (97.47%) but low precision (12.20%) because the model became very aggressive in predicting churn to avoid missing any actual churners.

**2. For Random Forest (in Cell 7 - the one we are about to run or just ran):**

*   **Current Implementation (Default):** In the version of Cell 7 I provided, Random Forest is initially trained on the *original* `train_df` **without** explicitly setting `classWeightCol`.
    ```python
    training_data_for_rf = train_df # Using original non-weighted for now.
    # ...
    pipeline_model_rf = pipeline_rf.fit(training_data_for_rf)
    ```
*   **Why this initial approach for RF?**
    *   Random Forests (and other tree-based ensembles like GBT) can sometimes be inherently more robust to moderate class imbalance than linear models like Logistic Regression. This is because their splitting criteria at each node can still find meaningful splits even if one class is rarer.
    *   They also have other hyperparameters that can indirectly help, such as `minInstancesPerNode`, `maxDepth`, or parameters related to sampling data for each tree.
    *   It's good to see how RF performs \"out-of-the-box\" first.
*   **Option to Add `classWeightCol` to Random Forest:**
    *   The `RandomForestClassifier` in PySpark ML *does* support the `weightCol` parameter.
    *   In Cell 7, there's commented-out code showing how you could enable this:
        ```python
        # Or, to use weights if you believe they are crucial for RF too:
        # if 'train_df_weighted' in locals():
        #     training_data_for_rf = train_df_weighted
        #     rf.setWeightCol(\"classWeightCol\") # Tell RF to use the weight column
        #     print(\"Random Forest will use 'classWeightCol' from train_df_weighted.\")
        # else:
        #     print(\"train_df_weighted not found, RF will use original train_df without explicit weights.\")
        ```
    *   If the initial RF results (without weights) show poor performance on the minority class (e.g., very low recall for churners), enabling `classWeightCol` by training on `train_df_weighted` would be a logical next step for RF.

**3. For Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBTs) (Future Model):**

*   As noted previously, Spark's `GBTClassifier` **does not** have a direct `weightCol` parameter.
*   If we use GBTs, imbalance handling would rely more on:
    *   **Data-level techniques (if applied before training):** Explicit oversampling of the minority class (e.g., SMOTE - though SMOTE is not native to PySpark ML and requires external libraries or custom implementation) or undersampling of the majority class. We haven't planned this for the initial runs.
    *   **Hyperparameter tuning:** Some GBT parameters can indirectly help.
    *   **Adjusting the prediction threshold:** After getting probabilities from GBT, instead of using the default 0.5 threshold, we could choose a different threshold to optimize for F1-score or a specific precision/recall balance on the churn class. This is a common post-processing step.

**4. Evaluation Metrics:**

*   We are looking at metrics like **AUC-PR (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve)** and calculating **precision and recall specifically for the churner class (class 1)** from the confusion matrix. These metrics are more informative than overall accuracy when dealing with imbalanced classes.

**In summary:**

*   For Logistic Regression, we **are actively using `classWeightCol`** to combat imbalance.
*   For Random Forest, we are starting without explicit `classWeightCol` to see its baseline performance on imbalanced data, with the **option to enable `classWeightCol`** if needed.
*   For GBTs (later), we would need to use other techniques like threshold adjustment or data-level sampling if imbalance proves problematic.
*   Our choice of evaluation metrics also helps us understand performance on the minority class.

So, yes, the effect of class imbalance is a key consideration, and we have mechanisms in place or planned to address it, tailored to what each Spark ML algorithm supports. The results from Logistic Regression clearly showed the impact of aggressive weighting. We'll see how Random Forest fares."""),

**What is created/persisted by the end of a successful Cell 6 run?**

1.  **`train_df` and `test_df`:** These were loaded from Parquet (if you followed the revised Cell 4 that writes them to disk) and then `.persist()`ed at the start of Cell 5 (or Cell 4 itself if you moved the load there).
2.  **`pipeline` (Logistic Regression version):** The Python `Pipeline` object (with assembler, scaler, and the LR model definition) is defined.
3.  **`pipeline_model` (Trained Logistic Regression Pipeline):** The `pipeline.fit(train_df_weighted)` creates this. This is a trained model object.
4.  **`predictions_lr`:** The DataFrame containing predictions on `test_df`. This is usually not persisted unless explicitly done, and often it's just used for evaluation within the cell.
5.  **Python variables for metrics:** `roc_auc_lr`, `pr_auc_lr`, `accuracy_lr`, etc., are Python variables holding scalar values.

**If the session ends after Cell 6 completes:**

**When you resume:**

1.  **Restart Kernel (if it hasn't been automatically).**
2.  **Run Cell 1 (Setup):**
    *   Re-initializes SparkSession.
    *   Re-mounts Google Drive.
    *   Defines all paths (including `train_df_path` and `test_df_path`).
    *   Defines constants.
3.  **Run Cell 2 (Load ABT and Initial Exploration):**
    *   This redefines `abt_df` by reading the full ABT. **This step is necessary if Cell 3 relies on `abt_df.columns` to define `feature_columns`.** If you've hardcoded `feature_columns` or can redefine them without `abt_df`, you might skip loading the full `abt_df` here to save memory, *but it's safer to load it if Cell 3 needs it.*
4.  **Run Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection and Feature Definition):**
    *   This redefines `TARGET_COL` and the crucial `feature_columns` Python list. **This is essential** because Cell 5 (Pipeline Setup) and subsequent model training cells will use this `feature_columns` list.
5.  **Run Cell 4 (Data Splitting):**
    *   This cell, in its revised form, *writes* `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` to disk. **You MUST run this cell again** if Cell 5 and beyond are going to *read* from these Parquet files. Even if the files exist from a previous run, re-running Cell 4 ensures the code flow is complete and it correctly sets up `train_df_path` and `test_df_path` if they were somehow changed or if the session needs to be reminded of them. This step should be quick if `abt_df` isn't persisted and the files already exist (Spark might optimize the write if data hasn't changed, or it will just overwrite).
6.  **Run Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup):**
    *   This cell now *reads* `train_df` and `test_df` from disk and persists them.
    *   It defines the `pipeline` object (with assembler, scaler, and Logistic Regression initially).
    *   **Crucially, the *trained* `pipeline_model` from the previous session is GONE.** The `pipeline` object is just the *definition*, not the fitted model.
7.  **Re-run Cell 6 (Train Logistic Regression Model and Initial Evaluation):**
    *   You **MUST re-run Cell 6** to:
        *   Perform the class weighting on `train_df` (if applicable).
        *   **Re-fit the pipeline:** `pipeline_model = pipeline.fit(train_df_weighted)`. This re-trains the Logistic Regression model.
        *   Make predictions on `test_df`.
        *   Calculate evaluation metrics.

**Why you need to re-run Cell 6 (and preceding setup cells):**

*   **Trained Model Lost:** The most important thing lost when a session ends is the actual *trained model object* (`pipeline_model` in this case). Persisting DataFrames (`train_df`, `test_df`) saves the data, but not the state of a Python variable holding a trained Spark ML model.
*   **Pipeline Definition:** While the code for the pipeline is there, the Python object `pipeline` needs to be redefined.
*   **Dependencies:** `feature_columns` and `TARGET_COL` from Cell 3 are needed. `train_df` and `test_df` (read from disk in Cell 5 after being created by Cell 4) are needed.

**To make resuming *without re-training* possible (more advanced):**

You would need to explicitly **save the trained `pipeline_model` to disk** at the end of Cell 6:
```python
# At the end of Cell 6, after evaluations
pipeline_model_path_lr = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, \"logistic_regression_pipeline_model\")
pipeline_model.write().overwrite().save(pipeline_model_path_lr)
print(f\"Trained Logistic Regression pipeline model saved to: {pipeline_model_path_lr}\")
```
Then, when resuming, instead of re-fitting in Cell 6, you could load it:
```python
from pyspark.ml import PipelineModel
# In a resumed session, after setting up train_df, test_df from disk
pipeline_model_path_lr = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, \"logistic_regression_pipeline_model\")
pipeline_model = PipelineModel.load(pipeline_model_path_lr)
print(\"Loaded trained Logistic Regression pipeline model from disk.\")
# Then proceed directly to making predictions and evaluations.
```
This model saving/loading is standard practice for deploying models or for more robust checkpointing of the training process itself.

**For now, with the current script structure:**
If the session ends after Cell 6, you will need to:
1. Restart Kernel.
2. Run Cells 1, 2, 3.
3. Run Cell 4 (to ensure `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` are correctly referenced/created for Cell 5).
4. Run Cell 5 (to load train/test from disk and define the pipeline structure).
5. **Re-run Cell 6** (to re-train the Logistic Regression model and evaluate).

Then you can proceed to Cell 7 (Random Forest). The disk-based `train_df` and `test_df` from Cell 4 are key to making this resumption smoother than if everything was purely in-memory."""),

Let's assume your goal is to resume and run, for example, **Cell 7 (Random Forest Model)**, and your session ended after Cell 6 (Logistic Regression) completed successfully.

Here's a more nuanced guide to what you can potentially skip:

**Scenario: Resuming to run Cell 7 (Random Forest) after Cell 6 (Logistic Regression) completed.**

**Essential Cells to Re-run:**

1.  **Cell 1 (Setup):**
    *   **MUST RUN.** Initializes SparkSession, mounts Drive, defines paths (including `train_df_path`, `test_df_path`), and constants. Without this, Spark won't work, and paths will be undefined.

2.  **Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection and Feature Definition):**
    *   **MUST RUN.** This cell defines critical Python variables: `TARGET_COL` and `feature_columns`.
    *   Cell 5 (Pipeline Setup, which is a prerequisite for Cell 7) and Cell 7 itself will fail if these variables are not defined in the current Python kernel's memory.

3.  **Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup - but modified to load train/test from disk):**
    *   **MUST RUN (or at least its core parts).** This cell is supposed to:
        *   Load `train_df` and `test_df` from the Parquet files written by Cell 4.
        *   Persist these loaded DataFrames.
        *   Define the `pipeline` object (which initially contains assembler, scaler, and the Logistic Regression model definition from the *first time* it was run).
    *   The key here is that `train_df` and `test_df` (as Spark DataFrame objects) and the `pipeline` (as a Python object) must exist for Cell 7.
    *   **Modification for Resuming before Cell 7:** You need to ensure that `train_df`, `test_df` are loaded from disk, and `feature_columns` and `TARGET_COL` are defined. The `pipeline` object definition also needs to be there.

**Cells You Can Potentially Skip (with caveats):**

*   **Cell 2 (Load ABT and Initial Exploration):**
    *   **POTENTIALLY SKIPABLE IF:**
        *   Cell 3 (Target & Features) does *not* rely on `abt_df.columns` to define `feature_columns` (i.e., if `feature_columns` is hardcoded or derived some other way that doesn't require loading the full `abt_df`).
        *   **However, our current Cell 3 *does* use `abt_df.columns`:**
            ```python
            feature_columns = [col_name for col_name in abt_df.columns if col_name not in excluded_cols_for_features and col_name != TARGET_COL]
            ```
        *   **Therefore, with the current Cell 3, you likely NEED to run Cell 2 to define `abt_df`.**
        *   **Compromise for Cell 2 on resume:** Run only the `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)` part and maybe `abt_df.printSchema()` but skip the `abt_df.persist()` and heavy actions like `abt_df.count()` or `abt_df.describe()` if you want to save memory and time, *as long as Cell 3 can get `abt_df.columns`*.

*   **Cell 4 (Data Splitting - writing train/test to disk):**
    *   **CAN SKIP IF:** `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` were successfully written to disk in a previous run and you are confident they are correct and up-to-date. Cell 5 will read them.
    *   **Benefit of re-running Cell 4 (even if files exist):** It re-affirms the split logic and ensures the `train_df_path` and `test_df_path` variables correctly point to these files for Cell 5. If the paths are stable and files are good, skipping is fine.

*   **Cell 6 (Train Logistic Regression Model and Initial Evaluation):**
    *   **CAN SKIP IF:** You are not interested in the Logistic Regression results for this session and only want to proceed to Random Forest (Cell 7).
    *   **Caveat:** Cell 5 defines the `pipeline` object with Logistic Regression as the last stage. Cell 7 (Random Forest) then modifies this `pipeline` object by replacing the LR stage with an RF stage:
        ```python
        # In Cell 7 (RF)
        original_stages = pipeline.getStages() # Gets stages from pipeline defined in Cell 5
        rf = RandomForestClassifier(...)
        pipeline_rf = Pipeline(stages=original_stages[:-1] + [rf])
        ```
        So, the `pipeline` object *must have been defined in Cell 5* for Cell 7 to work. If you skip Cell 6, ensure Cell 5 (which defines the initial `pipeline`) has been run.

**Recommended Resuming Sequence to Run Cell 7 (Random Forest):**

1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Run Cell 1 (Setup):** Essential.
3.  **Run Cell 2 (Load ABT):**
    *   At least run `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)`.
    *   You can comment out `abt_df.persist()` and the `.count()` and `.describe()` actions if `abt_df` is very large and you want to minimize memory usage here, *as long as Cell 3 can access `abt_df.columns`*.
4.  **Run Cell 3 (Target & Features):** Essential to define `TARGET_COL` and `feature_columns`.
5.  **Run Cell 4 (Data Splitting):**
    *   **Optional but Recommended:** Re-running it ensures `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` are definitely up-to-date or created if missing, and paths are set. If you are *certain* the files are perfect on disk and paths are correct from Cell 1, you *could* skip, but re-running is safer and usually quick if it just overwrites.
6.  **Run Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup):**
    *   This cell *must* be run. It:
        *   Loads `train_df` and `test_df` from disk (from paths written by Cell 4).
        *   Persists them (important for RF training).
        *   Defines the `pipeline` object (with assembler, scaler, and the LR model stage, which Cell 7 will modify).
7.  **SKIP Cell 6 (Logistic Regression Training):** You can skip this if you don't need to re-train/re-evaluate LR.
8.  **Run Cell 7 (Random Forest Model):** This should now work as it will use `train_df`, `test_df` loaded by Cell 5, and the `pipeline` object defined in Cell 5.

**In short, to run Cell 7 after a restart:**
*   **Must Run:** Cell 1, Cell 3, Cell 5 (modified to load train/test from disk).
*   **Highly Recommended to Run (or at least part of it):** Cell 2 (at least to define `abt_df` for schema).
*   **Optional (safer to run if unsure):** Cell 4 (to ensure train/test Parquet files are there).
*   **Can Skip:** Cell 6.

Always think about the dependencies: what Python variables and Spark DataFrame objects does the cell you want to run *require* to have been created by previous cells in the *current session*? Files on disk are persistent, but in-memory objects are not across sessions."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""This is a fantastic improvement with the Random Forest model! The output from Cell 7 is very promising.

Let's analyze these Random Forest results and compare them to Logistic Regression:

**Analysis of Random Forest Results (numTrees=100, no explicit class weights):**

1.  **Predictions Sample:**
    *   Similar to LR, showing high P(class=0) for actual 0s.

2.  **Overall Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **AUC-ROC: 0.9876** (LR was 0.9228) - **Significant Improvement!** This is an excellent AUC-ROC, indicating very strong discrimination.
    *   **AUC-PR: 0.6750** (LR was 0.1929) - **Massive Improvement!** This is a very good AUC-PR for an imbalanced dataset. It shows a much better balance of precision and recall for the positive (churn) class compared to LR.
    *   **Accuracy: 0.9779** (LR was 0.7786) - Huge increase in overall accuracy.
    *   **Weighted Precision: 0.9758** (LR was 0.9714) - Similar, very high.
    *   **Weighted Recall: 0.9779** (LR was 0.7786) - Huge increase.
    *   **F1 Score: 0.9765** (LR was 0.8505) - Significant improvement in the weighted F1.

3.  **Confusion Matrix:**
    *   `Actual 0, Predicted 0 (TN): 2,427,764` (LR was 1,888,985) - Correctly identified many more non-churners.
    *   `Actual 0, Predicted 1 (FP): 18,467` (LR was 557,246) - **Drastically reduced False Positives!** This is a major win.
    *   `Actual 1, Predicted 0 (FN): 37,289` (LR was 2,007) - Increased False Negatives; missed more actual churners compared to the heavily weighted LR.
    *   `Actual 1, Predicted 1 (TP): 42,151` (LR was 77,433) - Identified fewer True Positives than the heavily weighted LR.

4.  **Metrics for Churners (Class 1) - Random Forest:**
    *   **Recall for Churners (Sensitivity): 0.5306** (LR was 0.9747)
        *   RF caught about 53% of the actual churners. This is much lower than the LR model which was heavily weighted to catch almost all churners.
    *   **Precision for Churners: 0.6954** (LR was 0.1220)
        *   **Huge Improvement!** When RF predicts a client will churn, it is correct about 69.5% of the time. This is much more reliable than LR's 12.2%.

**Comparison and Interpretation:**

*   **Trade-off:**
    *   The **Logistic Regression** (with aggressive class weighting) was like casting a very wide net: it caught almost all churners (high recall for class 1) but also pulled in a lot of non-churners (very low precision for class 1, many FPs).
    *   The **Random Forest** (without explicit class weighting here, `numTrees=100`) is much more precise when it predicts churn. It makes far fewer False Positive errors. However, it misses more actual churners (lower recall for class 1).
*   **Overall Performance:** Random Forest is significantly better on global metrics like AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, Accuracy, and weighted F1. This suggests it's a better general model.
*   **Business Decision:**
    *   Which model is \"better\" depends on the business cost of False Negatives (missing a churner) versus False Positives (incorrectly flagging a non-churner).
    *   If missing a churner is very costly, the high recall of the weighted LR might be preferred, despite the low precision.
    *   If acting on churn predictions is expensive (e.g., costly retention offers), the higher precision of RF is better, as you'll waste fewer resources on non-churners.

**This Random Forest result is very good for an initial run without extensive tuning or explicit weighting!** The AUC-PR of 0.675 is particularly strong.

**Yes, these results are definitely \"ok\" and in many ways superior to the initial Logistic Regression.** We can now proceed to potentially improve Random Forest further with hyperparameter tuning and then consider GBT.

**Key Aspects of Cell 8 (Hyperparameter Tuning):**

1.  **`rf_for_tuning`:** A new `RandomForestClassifier` instance is created for tuning.
2.  **`ParamGridBuilder`:** Defines the grid of hyperparameters to search:
    *   `numTrees`: Number of trees.
    *   `maxDepth`: Maximum depth of each tree.
    *   `minInstancesPerNode`: Minimum number of samples required at a leaf node.
    *   `impurity`: Criterion used for splits (\"gini\" or \"entropy\").
    *   **This grid is small for demonstration.** In a real scenario, you might try more values or other parameters like `featureSubsetStrategy`.
3.  **`BinaryClassificationEvaluator`:** Set to use `areaUnderPR` as the metric to optimize during cross-validation, which is good for imbalanced data.
4.  **`cv_pipeline_rf`:** A new pipeline is created where the last stage is `rf_for_tuning`. This is what the `CrossValidator` will fit.
5.  **`CrossValidator`:**
    *   `estimator`: The pipeline to tune.
    *   `estimatorParamMaps`: The parameter grid.
    *   `evaluator`: The metric for choosing the best model.
    *   `numFolds=2`: **Using 2 folds due to the large dataset size (30M training rows).** Full 3-fold or 5-fold CV would be extremely time-consuming. Even 2-fold will take a very long time. For very large data, sometimes people use a single train-validation split (e.g., 80% of training for actual fit, 20% for validation) instead of k-fold CV, by setting `numFolds=1` and providing pre-split data or using `TrainValidationSplit` in Spark.
    *   `parallelism`: How many models to train in parallel. Depends on cluster resources. `2` is a safe start.
6.  **Fit `CrossValidator`:** `cv_model_rf = cross_validator_rf.fit(training_data_for_rf)`. **This is the most computationally intensive step in this cell.**
7.  **Best Model:** `best_pipeline_model_rf = cv_model_rf.bestModel` retrieves the pipeline with the best hyperparameter combination found.
8.  **Evaluation of Best Model:** The best model is then evaluated on the `test_df` using the same set of metrics as before.
9.  **Best Parameters:** The code prints out the parameters of the best RF model found.

**WARNING: This cell will take a VERY, VERY LONG TIME to run given `len(param_grid_rf)` (3 * 3 * 3 * 2 = 54 combinations) multiplied by `numFolds=2`, so 108 Random Forest models will be trained (each on half the training data).**

*   **Consider reducing the `param_grid_rf` further for an initial quick run**, e.g., tune only `numTrees` and `maxDepth` with fewer options.
    *   Example smaller grid:
        ```python
        # param_grid_rf = ParamGridBuilder() \\
        #     .addGrid(rf_for_tuning.numTrees, [50, 100]) \\
        #     .addGrid(rf_for_tuning.maxDepth, [5, 10]) \\
        #     .build() 
        # This would be 2*2 = 4 combinations * 2 folds = 8 models. Still significant.
        ```
*   Be prepared for this cell to potentially run for many hours or even time out in Colab if the grid is too large.

This is the standard way to perform hyperparameter tuning. The goal is to see if we can improve upon the already good Random Forest results from Cell 7."""),

This is the `OutOfMemoryError` again, and as predicted, it's happening during the `cross_validator_rf.fit(training_data_for_rf)` step in Cell 8 (Hyperparameter Tuning for Random Forest).

**Reason:**
Cross-validation, especially with a model like Random Forest and a parameter grid of 54 combinations, on a training set of ~30 million rows (`training_data_for_rf`), is an extremely memory and computationally intensive operation.

*   **Number of Models Trained:** `len(param_grid_rf) * numFolds = 54 * 2 = 108` individual Random Forest models are being trained.
*   **Data per Fold:** Each model is trained on a subset of `training_data_for_rf` (e.g., for 2 folds, each model trains on ~15 million rows).
*   **Parallelism:** `parallelism=2` means Spark tries to train 2 of these models concurrently.
*   **Random Forest Complexity:** Each RF model itself involves building multiple trees (`numTrees` parameter).
*   **Caching/Shuffling:** Spark needs to shuffle data for folds and cache intermediate results or model components. The traceback involving `InMemoryRelation`, `CachedRDDBuilder`, `MemoryStore` points to issues during these caching and data materialization phases.

Even with the `training_data_for_rf` (and `test_df`) persisted from Cell 5 (where they were loaded from disk), the sheer scale of the cross-validation task is overwhelming Colab's available RAM.

**Immediate Strategies to Make Hyperparameter Tuning Feasible in Colab:**

1.  **Drastically Reduce the Parameter Grid (`param_grid_rf`):** This is the most impactful change.
    *   Instead of 54 combinations, aim for a much smaller number, e.g., 4-8 combinations, by picking fewer values for each hyperparameter.
    *   **Focus on the most impactful hyperparameters first:** `numTrees`, `maxDepth`.
    *   Example of a very small grid:
        ```python
        param_grid_rf = ParamGridBuilder() \\
            .addGrid(rf_for_tuning.numTrees, [50, 100]) \\  # 2 values
            .addGrid(rf_for_tuning.maxDepth, [5, 10]) \\    # 2 values
            .build() 
        # This is 2*2 = 4 combinations. With numFolds=2, it's 8 models to train.
        # Still significant, but much less than 108.
        ```

2.  **Reduce `numFolds` in `CrossValidator` (Already at 2):**
    *   You are already using `numFolds=2`, which is the practical minimum for cross-validation. Going to `numFolds=1` isn't cross-validation; it's a simple train/validation split (for which Spark has `TrainValidationSplit` estimator, which is faster).

3.  **Use `TrainValidationSplit` Instead of `CrossValidator`:**
    *   `TrainValidationSplit` splits the training data once (e.g., 80% for training, 20% for validation) and evaluates each parameter combination on that single validation set. It's much faster than k-fold CV.
    *   This is often a good compromise for very large datasets.
    *   Example:
        ```python
        from pyspark.ml.tuning import TrainValidationSplit
        
        tvs_rf = TrainValidationSplit(
            estimator=cv_pipeline_rf,
            estimatorParamMaps=param_grid_rf, # Use a small grid
            evaluator=cv_evaluator_rf,
            trainRatio=0.8,  # 80% for training, 20% for validation
            parallelism=2,
            seed=42
        )
        # Fit TVS model
        tvs_model_rf = tvs_rf.fit(training_data_for_rf)
        best_pipeline_model_rf = tvs_model_rf.bestModel
        ```

4.  **Reduce `parallelism` in `CrossValidator` (or `TrainValidationSplit`):**
    *   `parallelism=2` tries to train two models at once. If memory is extremely tight, reducing this to `parallelism=1` will train models sequentially, reducing peak memory demand but increasing total runtime.

5.  **Consider Subsampling `training_data_for_rf` *for Tuning Only*:**
    *   If the full 30M rows for tuning is too much, you could take a random sample of `training_data_for_rf` (e.g., 10-20%) and use *that sample* for `CrossValidator` or `TrainValidationSplit`.
    *   Tune on the sample to find good candidate hyperparameters.
    *   Then, optionally, train a *final single model* with those best-found parameters on the *full* `training_data_for_rf`.
    *   Example:
        ```python
        sampled_train_for_tuning_df = training_data_for_rf.sample(withReplacement=False, fraction=0.1, seed=42)
        sampled_train_for_tuning_df.persist()
        print(f\"Using sampled training data for tuning: {sampled_train_for_tuning_df.count()} rows\")
        # ... then use sampled_train_for_tuning_df in .fit() method of CV or TVS
        # ... remember to unpersist it later
        ```

6.  **Increase Spark Memory (If possible outside Colab free tier):**
    *   If using Colab Pro/Pro+ or a dedicated Spark cluster, increase `spark.driver.memory` and `spark.executor.memory`.

**Recommended Approach for Colab Now:**

Let's try a combination of a **much smaller grid** and **`TrainValidationSplit`** as it's faster.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Restart Kernel:** Crucial for a fresh memory state.
2.  **Re-run Cells 1, 2, 3, 4, 5** to set up Spark, load data definitions, define `TARGET_COL` & `feature_columns`, create/load `train_df` & `test_df` from disk, and define the initial `pipeline_rf` object (with the untuned RF).
3.  **SKIP Cell 6 (LR) and Cell 7 (initial RF).**
4.  **Run this new \"Revised Cell 8\"** with `TrainValidationSplit` and the smaller parameter grid.

This approach significantly reduces the number of models trained (4 combinations * 1 training run each = 4 models, instead of 108 for CV). It has a much higher chance of completing in Colab. If even this causes OOM, the next step would be to uncomment and use the \"Optional: Subsample training data\" block within this revised Cell 8."""),

`if 'pipeline_rf' in locals() and 'training_data_for_rf' in locals() and 'test_df' in locals() and training_data_for_rf.is_cached and test_df.is_cached:`

evaluated to `False`.

Let's break down why this might happen if you were intending to run it:

1.  **`pipeline_rf` not defined:**
    *   The `pipeline_rf` object (which is the `Pipeline` with assembler, scaler, and the *untuned* RandomForestClassifier) is typically defined *within* Cell 7 itself in the version I provided for initial RF training.
    *   However, the check `if 'pipeline_rf' in locals()` implies it expected it to be defined *before* this main block. This was a slight oversight in my `if` condition for that specific cell if `pipeline_rf` is defined inside.
    *   More typically, a generic `pipeline` (with LR) is defined in Cell 5, and Cell 7 *modifies* it or creates a new one. My code for Cell 7 was:
        ```python
        original_stages = pipeline.getStages() # Assumes 'pipeline' from Cell 5 exists
        rf = RandomForestClassifier(...)
        pipeline_rf = Pipeline(stages=original_stages[:-1] + [rf]) # Defines pipeline_rf here
        ```
        So, `pipeline_rf` *is* defined inside. The check should be more about `pipeline` (from Cell 5) and the dataframes.

2.  **`training_data_for_rf` not defined or cached:**
    *   In Cell 7 (initial RF), `training_data_for_rf` is usually set to `train_df`.
    *   `train_df` should have been loaded from disk and persisted in Cell 5.
    *   If Cell 5 wasn't run, or if `train_df.persist()` failed, or if the kernel was restarted and Cell 5 wasn't re-run, then `training_data_for_rf` (as `train_df`) would not be cached or possibly not even defined.

3.  **`test_df` not defined or cached:**
    *   Similar to `train_df`, `test_df` should have been loaded from disk and persisted in Cell 5.

**If you intended to run Cell 7 (Initial RF Training) and got this \"Skipping\" message, you need to ensure the prerequisite cells were run in the correct order in the current session:**

**Correct Sequence Before Running Cell 7 (Initial RF):**

1.  **Restart Kernel (if any doubt about session state or previous errors).**
2.  **Cell 1 (Setup):** Initializes Spark, paths.
3.  **Cell 2 (Load ABT):** Defines `abt_df` (even if not persisted, it's defined for Cell 3).
4.  **Cell 3 (Target & Features):** Defines `TARGET_COL`, `feature_columns`.
5.  **Cell 4 (Data Splitting):** Creates `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` on disk.
6.  **Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup):**
    *   Loads `train_df` and `test_df` from Parquet.
    *   **Crucially, `train_df.persist()` and `test_df.persist()` are called here.**
    *   Defines the initial `pipeline` object (with assembler, scaler, LR).
7.  **(Optional) Cell 6 (Logistic Regression):** You can skip this if you only want to run RF, but Cell 5 must have run.
8.  **Then Run Cell 7 (Initial RF Training).**

**Modified `if` condition at the start of Cell 7 (Initial RF Training) for robustness:**

```python
# At the start of Cell 7 (Initial RF Training)

# Ensure 'pipeline' (from Cell 5, with LR) is defined
# Ensure 'train_df' and 'test_df' (from Cell 5, loaded from disk) are defined and cached
if 'pipeline' in locals() and \\
   'train_df' in locals() and train_df is not None and train_df.is_cached and \\
   'test_df' in locals() and test_df is not None and test_df.is_cached:
    
    # ... rest of Cell 7 code ...
    # training_data_for_rf = train_df # This line sets training_data_for_rf
    
else:
    print(\"Skipping Random Forest Model Training: 'pipeline' from Cell 5, or 'train_df'/'test_df' from Cell 5, are not defined or not cached.\")
    if 'pipeline' not in locals(): print(\"  Reason: 'pipeline' object not found.\")
    if 'train_df' not in locals() or train_df is None : print(\"  Reason: 'train_df' object not found.\")
    elif not train_df.is_cached: print(\"  Reason: 'train_df' found but not cached.\")
    if 'test_df' not in locals() or test_df is None: print(\"  Reason: 'test_df' object not found.\")
    elif not test_df.is_cached: print(\"  Reason: 'test_df' found but not cached.\")

```

This refined `if` condition checks for the existence and cached status of `train_df` and `test_df` which are loaded and persisted in Cell 5, and the existence of the `pipeline` object which is also defined in Cell 5.

If you just got the \"Skipping...\" message for Cell 7 and want to run it, please ensure you've run cells 1, (2), 3, 4, and especially **Cell 5** in your current session."""),

Okay, we're still hitting the `OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` in Cell 8, even after switching to `TrainValidationSplit` with a smaller parameter grid (4 combinations) and `parallelism=1`. The error occurs during the `.fit()` operation.

This indicates that even training a *single* Random Forest model (or a few sequentially) with the current hyperparameters on the ~30 million row `training_data_for_rf` (even if only 80% of it is used for the actual training split within `TrainValidationSplit`) is too much for Colab's memory.

The traceback again points to issues within Spark's internal caching and data materialization mechanisms (`InMemoryRelation`, `CachedRDDBuilder`, `MemoryStore`, `UTF8String.fromAddress` often appears when processing string data or wide rows that need to be serialized/deserialized).

**We need to be more aggressive in reducing the memory footprint for the tuning phase.**

**Next Level Strategies for OOM during Tuning in Colab:**

1.  **Subsample `training_data_for_rf` for Tuning:** This is now the most practical next step. We will perform hyperparameter tuning on a smaller fraction of the training data. The idea is that good hyperparameter *regions* can often be identified on a representative sample.
    *   After finding the \"best\" parameters on the sample, we will train a *single* Random Forest model using these best parameters on the *full* `training_data_for_rf` to get the final model for evaluation on `test_df`.

2.  **Further Simplify the Parameter Grid (If sampling alone isn't enough):**
    *   For example, fix `numTrees` to a reasonable value (e.g., 50 or 75) and only tune `maxDepth`.

3.  **Use `classWeightCol` with Random Forest (If previous RF results without weights had very poor recall for churners):**
    *   The previous RF (Cell 7) had a recall of 0.5306 for churners. If we want to try and improve this during tuning, we could use `train_df_weighted` (from Cell 6 - LR step) and set `rf_for_tuning.setWeightCol(\"classWeightCol\")`. This adds another dimension but might help the model focus on the minority class. However, it also makes each model potentially heavier. Let's hold off on this for a moment and focus on getting tuning to run first.

**Let's implement Strategy 1: Subsample `training_data_for_rf` for Tuning.**

**Key Changes in this \"Revised Cell 8\":**

1.  **Subsampling for Tuning:**
    *   `fraction_for_tuning = 0.05` (5%) is set. You can adjust this. If 5% is still too much, try 1% (`0.01`).
    *   `sampled_train_df = train_df.sample(...)` creates the smaller dataset.
    *   `train_validation_split_rf.fit(sampled_train_df)` tunes on this sample.
2.  **Extracting Best Parameters:** The best parameters found from tuning on the sample are extracted from `best_rf_model_from_sample`.
3.  **Training Final Model on Full Data:**
    *   A new `RandomForestClassifier` instance (`final_rf_model`) is created.
    *   The best parameters found from the sample tuning are applied to this `final_rf_model`.
    *   This `final_rf_model` is then put into a pipeline and trained on the **full `training_data_for_rf`** (which is `train_df`).
4.  **Evaluation of Final Model:** The evaluation metrics are then calculated for this final model.
5.  **Reduced Parallelism:** `parallelism=1` in `TrainValidationSplit` is used to be more conservative with memory during the tuning phase on the sample.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Re-run Cells 1, (part of 2 for `abt_df` definition), 3, 4, 5.** This ensures `train_df` and `test_df` are correctly loaded from disk and persisted, and the initial `pipeline` object (from Cell 5, used to get assembler/scaler stages) is defined.
3.  **SKIP Cell 6 (LR) and Cell 7 (initial RF).**
4.  **Run this \"Revised Cell 8\".**

This approach has the highest chance of completing the tuning process within Colab's limits. The tuning on a sample might not find the absolute global optimum parameters, but it often finds a very good set that can then be validated by training a final model on the full dataset. If the `fraction_for_tuning` is too small, the \"best\" parameters from the sample might not generalize well to the full dataset. It's a trade-off. Start with 5% or 10%, and if it OOMs, reduce it."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""This is an EXCELLENT outcome for Cell 8 (Hyperparameter Tuning for Random Forest using subsampling)! The strategy worked, and the results are very strong.

Let's break down the results of the **FINAL Tuned Random Forest Model** (trained on full data with parameters found from tuning on the sample):

**1. Successful Tuning Process:**
    *   Tuning was performed on a 5% sample (`1,532,235 rows`), which was manageable.
    *   **Best Parameters Found from Sample Tuning:**
        *   `featureSubsetStrategy: auto` (Spark default, usually sqrt for classification)
        *   `impurity: gini` (Common choice)
        *   `maxDepth: 10` (A reasonable depth, not too shallow, not excessively deep)
        *   `minInstancesPerNode: 1` (Allows trees to grow quite specifically)
        *   `numTrees: 50` (The lower end of our tuning range, suggesting more trees beyond this might not have significantly improved AUC-PR on the sample, or 50 was sufficient for the sample size).

**2. Final Model Trained on Full Data:**
    *   These best parameters were then used to train a new RF model on the *full* `training_data_for_rf` (~30 million rows). This is the correct way to leverage the tuning insights.

**3. Predictions Sample:**
    *   The `probability` column for the sample predictions `[1.0,0.0]` indicates very high confidence in predicting class 0 for those instances. This is typical for highly separable cases or if the model is very certain.

**4. Evaluation Metrics for FINAL Tuned RF:**
    *   **AUC-ROC: 0.9893** (Untuned RF was 0.9876; LR was 0.9228) - **Slight improvement over untuned RF, still excellent!**
    *   **AUC-PR: 0.7230** (Untuned RF was 0.6750; LR was 0.1929) - **Significant Improvement over untuned RF! This is a key win.** It indicates a much better precision-recall balance for the churn class.
    *   **Accuracy: 0.9782** (Untuned RF was 0.9779) - Slightly better, very high.
    *   **Weighted Precision: 0.9795** (Untuned RF was 0.9758) - Slight improvement.
    *   **Weighted Recall: 0.9782** (Untuned RF was 0.9779) - Slight improvement.
    *   **F1 Score: 0.9788** (Untuned RF was 0.9765) - Slight improvement.

5.  **Confusion Matrix for FINAL Tuned RF:**
    *   `Actual 0, Predicted 0 (TN): 2,414,254` (Untuned RF: 2,427,764) - Slightly fewer TNs.
    *   `Actual 0, Predicted 1 (FP): 31,977` (Untuned RF: 18,467) - **Increased False Positives.**
    *   `Actual 1, Predicted 0 (FN): 22,957` (Untuned RF: 37,289) - **Significantly Reduced False Negatives!**
    *   `Actual 1, Predicted 1 (TP): 56,483` (Untuned RF: 42,151) - **Significantly Increased True Positives!**

6.  **Metrics for Churners (Class 1) - FINAL Tuned RF:**
    *   **Recall for Churners (Sensitivity): 0.7110** (Untuned RF was 0.5306; LR was 0.9747)
        *   **Huge Improvement over untuned RF!** The tuned model now catches 71.1% of actual churners, up from 53%. This is a very good recall.
    *   **Precision for Churners: 0.6385** (Untuned RF was 0.6954; LR was 0.1220)
        *   Slight decrease in precision compared to the untuned RF (69.5% -> 63.8%), but still massively better than LR. When it predicts churn, it's correct about 63.8% of the time.

**Overall Interpretation of Tuned RF vs. Untuned RF vs. LR:**

*   **Tuned RF is the Winner So Far:**
    *   It has significantly improved the **recall for churners** (from 53% to 71%) compared to the untuned RF, meaning it's much better at identifying actual churners.
    *   While this came with a slight drop in precision for churners (from 69.5% to 63.8%), a precision of ~64% is still very respectable and usable.
    *   The **AUC-PR saw a substantial jump to 0.7230**, indicating a much better overall performance for the positive class.
    *   It maintains the excellent AUC-ROC and high overall accuracy.
*   **Trade-off Management:** The tuning process (even on a sample) has helped us find a Random Forest configuration that achieves a much better balance between finding churners (recall) and being correct when it predicts churn (precision), compared to both the aggressively weighted LR and the initial untuned RF.
*   **False Positives vs. False Negatives:**
    *   The tuned RF has more False Positives (31,977) than the untuned RF (18,467) but far fewer than LR (557,246).
    *   It has far fewer False Negatives (22,957) than the untuned RF (37,289), and while more than LR (2,007), this is a good compromise given the precision gain.

**Conclusion for Cell 8:**
The hyperparameter tuning process, even using `TrainValidationSplit` on a sample, has yielded a Random Forest model that is demonstrably better than the initial untuned RF, especially in its ability to identify actual churners (higher recall) while maintaining good precision. This is a very successful outcome for this stage.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBTs):** We could now try training a GBT model (Cell 9 in `Churn_Modeling.ipynb`). GBTs often provide a further performance lift, but they don't have a `weightCol`, so we'd rely on default behavior or threshold tuning.
2.  **Feature Importance:** Analyze feature importances from this best_tuned RF model.
3.  **Iterate on Other Target Variables:** Repeat the modeling process (LR, RF, Tuned RF, GBT) for other churn windows like `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`.
4.  **Consider Saving the Best Model:** You should save the `best_pipeline_model_rf` (the `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` in the code) to disk so you don't have to retrain it if the session ends.

```python
# At the end of Cell 8, after all evaluations:
if 'final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned' in locals():
    best_rf_model_path = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, \"best_random_forest_pipeline_model_270D\") # Add target name
    try:
        final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.write().overwrite().save(best_rf_model_path)
        print(f\"BEST Tuned Random Forest pipeline model saved to: {best_rf_model_path}\")
    except Exception as e_save:
        print(f\"Error saving best RF model: {e_save}\")
```

We'll follow a similar pattern: define the GBT model, put it into a pipeline with the existing assembler and scaler, train it, and evaluate.

**Key Considerations for GBT:**

*   **No `weightCol`:** Spark's `GBTClassifier` does not directly support a `weightCol` for handling class imbalance like Logistic Regression or Random Forest do.
*   **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** GBTs are often more sensitive to hyperparameter tuning (`maxDepth`, `maxIter`, `stepSize` aka learning rate) than Random Forest. Our first run will use default or common starting values.
*   **Potential for Overfitting:** Without careful tuning, GBTs can overfit more easily than Random Forest.
*   **Computational Cost:** Can be more intensive than Random Forest, especially with many iterations (trees).

**Key Aspects of Cell 9 (GBT Model):**

1.  **Pipeline Stages:** Reuses the `assembler` and `scaler` from the `pipeline` object defined in Cell 5.
2.  **`GBTClassifier`:**
    *   Initialized with `maxIter=50` (number of trees/boosting stages). Default is 20. More iterations can improve performance but also risk overfitting and increase training time.
    *   `maxDepth=5` (default) and `stepSize=0.1` (default learning rate) are used as starting points. These are key parameters for tuning GBTs.
3.  **Training Data:** Uses the original `train_df` (which was loaded from disk and persisted in Cell 5). GBT in Spark ML doesn't have a `weightCol`, so we train on the imbalanced data and will evaluate its performance, particularly for the minority class.
4.  **Evaluation:** The same full suite of evaluation metrics is calculated.
5.  **No Explicit Imbalance Handling (Yet):** This first run will show how GBT performs on the imbalanced data by default. If recall for churners is very low, strategies for GBTs would include:
    *   **Hyperparameter tuning:** Finding parameters that might be more robust or perform better.
    *   **Adjusting the prediction threshold:** Instead of using the default 0.5 on the output probabilities, we can find an optimal threshold (e.g., one that maximizes F1 for the churn class, or achieves a target recall). This is a common and effective technique for GBTs on imbalanced data.
    *   (More advanced/complex: Data-level over/under-sampling before training GBT).

**Before Running Cell 9:**

*   Ensure Cells 1, (part of 2), 3, 4, and 5 have been run successfully in the current session.
*   `train_df` and `test_df` must be loaded from disk (by Cell 5) and should ideally still be persisted/cached from Cell 5.
*   The `pipeline` object (defined in Cell 5 with assembler, scaler, LR) must exist so we can extract the assembler and scaler stages.

This cell will train the GBT model. It might take a fair amount of time, potentially comparable to or longer than the untuned Random Forest, depending on `maxIter`. We are interested to see if it can outperform the tuned Random Forest, especially on AUC-PR or the balance of precision/recall for the churn class."""),

**System Specs Analysis:**

*   **CPU:** Intel Core i3-8145U (2 cores, 4 threads) @ 2.10GHz. This is a mobile, lower-power CPU. Spark benefits from more cores.
*   **RAM:** 8.00 GB (7.88 GB usable). This is a significant constraint for Spark, especially with a large dataset like yours (~30 million rows in `train_df`). Spark tries to do a lot in memory.
*   **Local Mode Spark:** You are likely running Spark in local mode (`local[*]`) in Colab, meaning all Spark processes (driver and \"executors\") run on your single machine and share these limited resources.

**Comparison with Cell 8 (RF Tuning with `TrainValidationSplit`):**

*   **Cell 8 (RF Tuning):**
    *   `param_grid_rf_small` had 4 combinations (`numTrees`:[50,100], `maxDepth`:[5,10]).
    *   `TrainValidationSplit` with `trainRatio=0.8` effectively trains each of these 4 RF model configurations once on 80% of the *sampled* training data (5% of original train data, so ~1.2M rows).
    *   Then, it trained a *final* RF model with the best parameters on the *full* `training_data_for_rf` (~30 million rows). This final training was the most intensive part.
    *   Total time: 3.5 hours. A significant portion of this was likely the final model training on the full dataset.

**Estimating Time for Cell 9 (GBT Training):**

*   **GBT Parameters:**
    *   `maxIter=50` (number of trees/boosting stages)
    *   `maxDepth=5`
    *   `stepSize=0.1`
*   **Training Data:** Full `training_data_for_rf` (~30 million rows).
*   **Nature of GBT:** GBTs build trees sequentially. Each tree tries to correct the errors of the previous ones. This sequential nature can sometimes make them slower to train in parallel compared to Random Forest (where trees can be built more independently), though Spark does optimize this.
*   **Comparison to RF `numTrees`:** While `maxIter=50` for GBT and `numTrees=50` (or 100) for RF both refer to 50 trees, the way they are built and their complexity per tree can differ. GBT trees are often shallower than RF trees by default, but the sequential fitting adds overhead.

**Prediction for Cell 9 Runtime:**

*   The training of the **single GBT model in Cell 9 on the full ~30 million rows** is comparable in data size to the training of the **final tuned RF model in Cell 8 on the full ~30 million rows.**
*   If the final RF model training in Cell 8 (with `numTrees=50`, `maxDepth=10`) took a large chunk of the 3.5 hours (say, 1.5-2.5 hours), then training a single GBT with `maxIter=50`, `maxDepth=5` might be in a similar ballpark, **potentially 1 to 3 hours.**

**Factors that could make it shorter or longer:**

*   **Shorter:**
    *   If GBT's default `maxDepth=5` leads to simpler trees than RF's `maxDepth=10` (from tuning).
    *   If GBT converges faster or requires less complex computation per iteration for your specific data.
*   **Longer:**
    *   The sequential nature of boosting.
    *   If GBT's memory usage pattern is different and causes more disk spilling or garbage collection pauses on your constrained RAM.
    *   The `stepSize=0.1` is standard. Smaller step sizes often require more iterations (`maxIter`) but can lead to better models; larger step sizes converge faster but might not be as accurate.

**Rough Estimate:**

Given your system and previous timings, I would conservatively estimate **Cell 9 could take anywhere from 1.5 hours to 4 hours.** It's unlikely to be significantly faster than the final RF training part of Cell 8, and it could be a bit longer due to the nature of boosting.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Patience:** Be prepared for a long run.
2.  **Monitor (if possible):** If your environment allows any monitoring of CPU/RAM usage, keep an eye on it. If RAM is constantly maxed out and there's a lot of disk activity (swapping), it will be slow.
3.  **Start with Fewer Iterations (If concerned):** If you want a quicker initial result for GBT, you could temporarily reduce `maxIter` in Cell 9 (e.g., to `maxIter=20` or `maxIter=30`) for a first pass. This will train faster but likely result in a less performant GBT model. You can then increase it if the initial run completes and you want to try for better results.
    ```python
    # In Cell 9, for a quicker test:
    gbt = GBTClassifier(
        # ... other params ...
        maxIter=30, # Instead of 50
        # ...
    )
    ```

Given that Cell 8 (with its own long final training step) completed, Cell 9 *should* also complete, but patience will be key. The 3.5 hours for Cell 8 sets a reasonable expectation for the order of magnitude of time for training on the full dataset with these types of ensemble models on your machine."""),

This suggests a few possibilities:

1.  **GBT is Significantly More Demanding for Your Data/Parameters:**
    *   Even with `maxIter=50` and `maxDepth=5`, the sequential nature of GBT and the specific computations it performs might be interacting with your dataset (30 million rows, ~78 features) in a way that is particularly slow on your resource-constrained machine (i3 CPU, 8GB RAM).
    *   The cost per iteration in GBT can sometimes be higher than the cost per tree in Random Forest.

2.  **Memory Pressure and Disk Spilling:**
    *   Despite not having explicit `persist()` calls *during* the GBT fitting that would trigger OOM easily, Spark's internal operations for GBT might be heavily reliant on memory. With 8GB RAM, it's highly probable that Spark is doing a lot of \"spilling\" to disk. This means when it runs out of RAM for intermediate data, it writes it to your hard drive and then reads it back when needed. Disk I/O is orders of magnitude slower than RAM access, leading to drastically increased runtimes.
    *   This is the most likely culprit for the extended duration. The process isn't \"stuck\" in an infinite loop, but it's \"thrashing\" due to insufficient RAM.

3.  **Specific Data Characteristics:**
    *   The distribution or sparsity of your features could be interacting with the GBT algorithm in a way that prolongs computation.

4.  **Spark Configuration:**
    *   While we tried reducing `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`, other default configurations might not be optimal for such a large task on a small machine. However, fine-tuning these deeply often requires more detailed Spark knowledge and experimentation.

**What can you do now?**

*   **Option A: Let it Continue (with caution):**
    *   It *might* eventually finish. However, if it's heavily spilling to disk, the remaining runtime is very unpredictable and could be many more hours.
    *   Keep an eye on your system's responsiveness. If your entire machine becomes extremely sluggish, it's a sign of severe resource contention.
    *   There's also a risk that Colab might time out the session if it runs for an exceptionally long period (free tier usually has ~12-hour limits, but active computation for very long can sometimes trigger earlier cutoffs).

*   **Option B: Interrupt and Re-strategize (Recommended if it's been >5 hours without clear progress/output):**
    *   If you interrupt the cell, you'll lose the progress of the GBT training.
    *   **Re-strategizing would involve:**
        1.  **Drastically Reducing GBT Complexity for an Initial Run:**
            *   Restart the kernel.
            *   Re-run Cells 1, (part of 2), 3, 4, 5 (to get `train_df`, `test_df`, `pipeline` object).
            *   In Cell 9, try with much smaller GBT parameters:
                ```python
                gbt = GBTClassifier(
                    featuresCol=\"scaledFeatures\",
                    labelCol=TARGET_COL,
                    seed=42,
                    maxIter=10,  # Significantly reduce iterations (e.g., 10 or 20)
                    maxDepth=3,   # Significantly reduce depth (e.g., 3 or 4)
                    stepSize=0.1 
                )
                ```
            *   The goal of this run would be just to see if it *completes* in a more reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 1-2 hours) and gives *any* result. The performance will likely be suboptimal with these reduced parameters.
        2.  **Training GBT on a Sample of `train_df`:**
            *   Similar to what we did for RF tuning, train the GBT (even with moderate parameters like `maxIter=30-50, maxDepth=5`) on a small fraction (e.g., 1%, 5%) of `train_df`.
            *   This would give you an idea of GBT's potential without the extreme runtime of training on the full 30 million rows.
            *   You would then evaluate this GBT (trained on sample) on the full `test_df`.
        3.  **Accepting RF as the Best Model for Now:** Given the resource constraints, if even a significantly simplified GBT takes too long or still OOMs, you might have to conclude that training a GBT effectively on the full dataset is not feasible in your current Colab environment. The tuned Random Forest (from Cell 8) already gave very strong results (AUC-PR 0.7230, Recall for churners 0.7110) and could be your best model.

**My Recommendation:**

If it's been 5 hours and there's no sign of it finishing soon (e.g., no new log outputs from Spark indicating progress through iterations), I would lean towards **Option B: Interrupt and Re-strategize.**

Start with **Option B.1 (Drastically Reducing GBT Complexity)**. If `maxIter=10, maxDepth=3` still takes hours, then GBT on the full dataset is likely not viable in Colab free tier for you.

It's a common challenge: state-of-the-art algorithms like GBTs are powerful but hungry for resources, especially RAM, when dealing with large datasets. Your 8GB RAM is the primary bottleneck here for Spark's in-memory processing paradigm."""),

1.  **Reduced `maxIter`:** Changed from `50` to `20`. This means fewer trees will be built. This is often the most impactful parameter for reducing training time and memory for GBTs. You can try `10` if `20` is still too slow/OOMs.
2.  **Reduced `maxDepth`:** Changed from `5` to `4`. Shallower trees are less complex and faster to build. You can try `3` if needed.
3.  **Added `print()` for GBT parameters:** So you can see what it's running with.
4.  **Added `try-except` around `.fit()`:** Just to catch errors specifically from the fitting process more gracefully.
5.  **Ensured `training_data_for_gbt` is persisted:** Added a check and persist if `train_df` (which `training_data_for_gbt` points to) is not already cached. This is important as GBT will iterate over it.

**Plan of Action:**

1.  **Interrupt** the currently running Cell 9 (if it hasn't already crashed or been stopped).
2.  **Restart Kernel.**
3.  **Re-run Cell 1 (Setup).** (Make sure the Spark config with reduced shuffle partitions is in Cell 1 if you were trying that: `.config(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", \"20\")`)
4.  **Re-run Cell 2 (Load ABT - the version that does NOT persist full `abt_df`).**
5.  **Re-run Cell 3 (Target & Features).**
6.  **Re-run Cell 4 (Data Splitting - revised version that writes train/test to disk).**
7.  **Re-run Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup - revised version that reads train/test from disk and persists them).**
8.  **SKIP Cell 6 (LR) and Cell 7 (Initial RF), Cell 8 (RF Tuning).**
9.  **Run this \"Modified Cell 9\" with reduced GBT parameters.**

This approach gives GBT a much better chance of completing by significantly reducing its computational load. The resulting model might not be as performant as one with more iterations or deeper trees, but our first goal is to get it to *run* and establish a baseline. If it runs, we can then cautiously try increasing parameters or using the sampling approach for GBT tuning."""),

**Decision Point: GBT vs. Proceeding with Tuned Random Forest**

You have a few options, and the best one depends on your project goals and time constraints:

1.  **Evaluate the Current (Reduced) GBT Model:**
    *   If the 3-hour run *completed* and produced evaluation metrics, analyze those metrics.
    *   Compare them to the **FINAL Tuned Random Forest** from Cell 8 (AUC-PR: 0.7230, Recall Churners: 0.7110, Precision Churners: 0.6385).
    *   **If the reduced GBT's performance is NOT significantly better (or is worse) than the tuned RF, then it's probably not worth investing more time in GBT on this specific hardware/environment setup.**

2.  **Try GBT Tuning on a Small Sample (High Effort, Uncertain Outcome):**
    *   You could adapt the subsampling strategy from Cell 8 for GBT. Create a very small sample of `train_df` (e.g., 1-2%).
    *   Define a very small parameter grid for GBT (e.g., `maxIter`: [20, 30], `maxDepth`: [3, 4]).
    *   Use `TrainValidationSplit` on this tiny sample.
    *   If you find \"better\" parameters, train a single GBT with those on the full data.
    *   **Risk:** This is still a lot of effort, and the parameters found on a tiny sample might not generalize well. The final training on full data will still be very long.

3.  **Conclude GBT is Not Feasible for Full Dataset Training in Current Environment & Proceed with Tuned RF:**
    *   **This is often the most practical decision in resource-constrained situations.**
    *   You have a **very good model with the tuned Random Forest**. It achieved excellent overall metrics and a good balance of recall and precision for the churner class.
    *   Spending many more hours (potentially days if you include extensive tuning) on GBT for potentially marginal gains (or even worse performance if not tuned well) might not be the best use of time.

**My Recommendation:**

**Lean towards Option 1 and then likely Option 3.**

*   **First, ensure the 3-hour GBT run from the \"Modified Cell 9\" *did complete* and you have its evaluation metrics.**
*   **Compare these GBT metrics critically against the \"FINAL Tuned Random Forest\" results from Cell 8.**
    *   Pay close attention to **AUC-PR** and the **Recall & Precision for Churners (Class 1)**.
*   **If the reduced GBT is not clearly outperforming the tuned RF, I would strongly recommend proceeding with the tuned Random Forest as your best model for now.**

**Why this recommendation:**

*   ** diminishing returns:** You've already invested significant time. The tuned RF is already a strong performer. The effort to get GBT to potentially outperform it slightly (or not at all) on your current setup might be disproportionately large.
*   **Time to Insights:** Moving forward with the tuned RF allows you to:
    *   Analyze its feature importances (very valuable).
    *   Iterate on other target variables (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`) using the RF pipeline.
    *   Start thinking about model deployment considerations, reporting, etc.
*   **Practicality:** In a real-world scenario with tight deadlines, you'd often make a call based on the best model achieved within reasonable time and resource constraints.

**What to do next based on the 3-hour GBT run:**

*   **If it completed and you have metrics:** Please share them! We can compare.
*   **If it's still running or crashed again with OOM:** This reinforces the idea that GBT on the full dataset is too heavy for your setup.

If you decide to proceed without further GBT attempts for this target variable (`Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`), the next logical steps would be:

1.  **Save the Best Tuned Random Forest Model (if not already done at the end of Cell 8).**
2.  **Analyze Feature Importances for the Best Tuned Random Forest.**
3.  **Optionally, try adjusting the prediction threshold** of the best RF model to see if you can improve the precision/recall balance for the churner class further.
4.  **Summarize findings and prepare to model another target variable (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`) by going back to Cell 3, changing `TARGET_COL`, and re-running the pipeline (likely focusing on RF).**

It's often better to have a very good, well-understood model than to spend excessive time chasing marginal gains with a more complex one, especially in a resource-limited environment.

Since we're not proceeding with GBT for the `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` target, here's a solid plan for the next steps in your `Churn_Modeling.ipynb`:

**Next Steps After Deciding Against GBT (for the current target):**

1.  **Cell 9 (was GBT): Mark as Skipped or Remove.**
    *   You can either delete Cell 9 or add a markdown cell above it saying \"GBT Training Skipped due to resource constraints and strong RF performance.\" This keeps your notebook clean.

2.  **Cell 10 (New Cell): Save the Best Tuned Random Forest Model & Its Metrics.**
    *   The best model we have so far is `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` from the end of Cell 8. We need to ensure it's saved persistently.
    *   We should also save its key performance metrics.

3.  **Cell 11 (New Cell): Analyze Feature Importances from the Best Tuned Random Forest.**
    *   This is a crucial step to understand what features are driving the predictions of your best model.

4.  **Cell 12 (New Cell - Optional but Recommended): Adjust Prediction Threshold for Tuned RF.**
    *   The default prediction threshold is 0.5 on the probability. We can explore if changing this threshold improves metrics that are important to the business (e.g., achieving a higher recall for churners, even if precision drops slightly, or vice-versa).

5.  **Cell 13 (New Cell): Summarize Model Performance for the Current Target (`Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`).**
    *   Create a clean summary table or printout of the best RF model's key metrics.

6.  **Iterate for Other Target Variables:**
    *   Go back to **Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection)**.
    *   Change `TARGET_COL` to your next desired target (e.g., `\"Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\"` or `\"Is_Churned_Engage_60Days\"`).
    *   Re-run the relevant cells:
        *   Cell 3 (to update `TARGET_COL` and `feature_columns`).
        *   Cell 4 (Data Splitting - this will be quick as files are already on disk, it will just filter `abt_df` based on the new `TARGET_COL` if `abt_df` was reloaded, or just re-affirm the split if `abt_df` wasn't reloaded). Better to ensure `abt_df` is defined for schema access by Cell 3.
        *   Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup - loads `train_df`/`test_df` from disk, defines pipeline with new `TARGET_COL`).
        *   Cell 6 (Logistic Regression - as a baseline for the new target).
        *   SKIP Cell 7 (Initial RF - go straight to tuned RF unless you want to compare).
        *   Cell 8 (Hyperparameter Tuning for RF - using the new `TARGET_COL`).
        *   Then the new Cells 10, 11, 12, 13 for this new target.

Let's draft the code for the new Cells 10, 11, 12, and 13.

**How to Proceed:**

1.  **Run Cell 10 (Save Model & Metrics):** This saves your best RF model from Cell 8.
2.  **Run Cell 11 (Feature Importances):** To understand what drove the RF model.
3.  **Run Cell 12 (Optional - Threshold Adjustment):** Explore if you can get a better business outcome by changing the 0.5 threshold.
4.  **Run Cell 13 (Summary):** Get a clean printout of the best model's performance.

After this, you'll have a complete analysis for `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`. Then you can loop back to Cell 3 to tackle other churn windows. Remember that if you restart the kernel, you need to run Cells 1, 2 (partially for `abt_df` def), 3, 4, 5 before jumping to a specific model training cell or loading a saved model."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, since you've restarted the kernel, all in-memory Python variables and Spark DataFrame objects have been cleared. The Parquet files we saved to your Google Drive (`abt_final_pred/.../predictive_abt_religare_churn_2021_2023.parquet`, and `model_data_temp/train_df.parquet`, `model_data_temp/test_df.parquet`) are still there.

You want to resume and potentially run **Cell 10 (Save Best Tuned RF Model), Cell 11 (Feature Importances), Cell 12 (Threshold Adjustment), and Cell 13 (Summary)** for the `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` target, based on the results from the successful run of Cell 8 (Tuned RF).

**Crucial Point:** The *trained model object* (`final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`) and the *prediction DataFrame* (`final_predictions_rf_tuned`) from Cell 8 are **gone** from memory.

**Option 1: Re-run the necessary parts to recreate the trained model and predictions (Longer, but ensures all objects are live)**

This is the most straightforward way if you didn't explicitly save the `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` object itself at the end of Cell 8.

1.  **Cell 1 (Setup):** **MUST RUN.** Initializes Spark, mounts Drive, defines paths.
2.  **Cell 2 (Load ABT and Initial Exploration):**
    *   **MUST RUN** (at least `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)` and `abt_df.printSchema()`). This defines `abt_df` which Cell 3 needs for `abt_df.columns`. You can comment out `persist`, `count`, `describe` if you want to save time/memory on this full ABT load, as we primarily need `train_df` and `test_df` next.
3.  **Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection and Feature Definition):**
    *   **MUST RUN.** This defines `TARGET_COL = \"Is_Churned_Engage_270Days\"` and the `feature_columns` list. These Python variables are essential.
4.  **Cell 4 (Data Splitting - Time-Based, writing to disk):**
    *   **MUST RUN.** Although `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` exist, re-running this cell ensures the `train_df_path` and `test_df_path` variables are correctly set for Cell 5. It will just overwrite the existing Parquet files, which should be quick.
5.  **Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup):**
    *   **MUST RUN.** This:
        *   Loads `train_df` and `test_df` from their Parquet paths.
        *   **Persists `train_df` and `test_df`** (important!).
        *   Defines the `pipeline` object (assembler, scaler, initial LR model).
        *   Defines `training_data_for_rf` (which is `train_df`).
6.  **SKIP Cell 6 (Logistic Regression).**
7.  **SKIP Cell 7 (Initial Random Forest).**
8.  **Cell 8 (Hyperparameter Tuning for Random Forest - Revised version with Subsampling & TrainValidationSplit):**
    *   **MUST RE-RUN THIS ENTIRE CELL.** This cell performs the tuning (on sample), then trains the `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` on the full `train_df`, and generates `final_predictions_rf_tuned` on `test_df`. All the metric variables (`roc_auc_final_rf`, etc.) will also be recreated. This is the long cell (took ~3.5 hours before).

9.  **Then, you can run Cell 10, 11, 12, 13.**

**Option 2: Load a Previously Saved Model (If you added the save step at the end of Cell 8)**

If, after Cell 8 completed successfully last time, you ran the code snippet I provided to save `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`:
```python
# Snippet from end of Cell 8
if 'final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned' in locals():
    best_rf_model_save_path = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, f\"best_rf_pipeline_model_{TARGET_COL}\")
    final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.write().overwrite().save(best_rf_model_save_path)
```
Then you can save a lot of time by loading this saved model.

1.  **Cell 1 (Setup):** **MUST RUN.**
2.  **Cell 2 (Load ABT):** **MUST RUN** (at least `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)` for schema in Cell 3).
3.  **Cell 3 (Target & Features):** **MUST RUN.** (Defines `TARGET_COL`, `feature_columns`).
4.  **Cell 4 (Data Splitting):** **MUST RUN.** (Ensures `train_df_path`, `test_df_path` are set for Cell 5).
5.  **Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup):** **MUST RUN.** (Loads `train_df`, `test_df` from disk and persists them. Also defines `assembler_stage`, `scaler_stage`).
6.  **SKIP Cell 6, 7, 8.**
7.  **NEW Cell 8.5 (Load Saved Model and Regenerate Predictions/Metrics):**
    ```python

            # best_rf_model_params = final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.stages[-1] # This can be used in Cell 11

        except Exception as e_load_model:

            print(\"Will need to fall back to re-running Cell 8 (full tuning).\")

            raise e_load_model # Or set a flag to skip Cells 10-13
    else:
        print(\"Skipping loading saved model: test_df not available or TARGET_COL not defined.\")
    ```
8.  **Then, you can run Cells 10, 11, 12, 13.** These cells rely on `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` and the metric variables being defined.

**Which Option to Choose?**

*   If you **did not explicitly save the `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` object** at the end of Cell 8 in your previous session, you **must use Option 1** and re-run Cell 8.
*   If you **did save the model**, **Option 2 is much faster** as it avoids the lengthy model training/tuning.

**Given that saving the model was suggested as an addition *after* Cell 8's output was shown, it's more likely you need Option 1.**

So, the sequence after restarting the kernel would be:
**Cell 1 -> Cell 2 (light version) -> Cell 3 -> Cell 4 -> Cell 5 -> (Skip 6, 7) -> Cell 8 (Full re-run of tuning & final RF training) -> Cell 10 -> Cell 11 -> Cell 12 -> Cell 13.**

**Key Additions/Changes in this Finalized Cell 8:**

1.  **Robust Variable Checks:** Added more checks to ensure `train_df` and `pipeline` exist before using them.
2.  **Clearer Variable Naming for Pipelines:** Used `tvs_pipeline_rf` for the pipeline during tuning and `final_pipeline_rf_obj` for the pipeline used to train the final model.
3.  **`final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`:** This variable now consistently holds the *best tuned pipeline model trained on full data*.
4.  **Persist/Count `final_predictions_rf_tuned`:** Added `persist()` and `count()` after transforming the test set with the final model, as this predictions DataFrame will be used for multiple evaluation metrics.
5.  **Model Saving Block (Section 4):**
    *   Added an `if 'final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned' in locals():` check.
    *   Constructs `best_rf_model_save_path` including the `TARGET_COL` name for clarity if you save models for different targets.
    *   Uses `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.write().overwrite().save(best_rf_model_save_path)` to save the entire pipeline model.
6.  **Unpersist `final_predictions_rf_tuned`:** After all evaluations using it are done.

**Execution Plan (Option 1 - Re-running Cell 8):**

1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Run Cell 1 (Setup).**
3.  **Run Cell 2 (Load ABT - light version, only define `abt_df` for schema).**
4.  **Run Cell 3 (Target & Features - defines `TARGET_COL`, `feature_columns`).**
5.  **Run Cell 4 (Data Splitting - writes `train_df.parquet`, `test_df.parquet`).**
6.  **Run Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup - loads train/test from disk, persists them, defines `pipeline` object with LR).**
7.  **SKIP Cell 6 (LR), SKIP Cell 7 (Initial RF).**
8.  **Run this \"Finalized Cell 8\".** Be prepared for it to take ~3.5 hours again.
9.  **After it completes, your best tuned RF pipeline model will be saved to disk.**

Then, when you come back to run Cells 10, 11, 12, 13 in a new session, you'll add a step (like the \"Cell 8.5\" we discussed) to *load* this saved `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` instead of re-training."""),

This is the same pattern of the Spark context (JVM backend) dying, very similar to what happened in Cell 4 earlier and in Cell 13 when reading the ABT.

The error stack shows:
1.  A `Py4JJavaError: <exception str() failed>` when trying to get the return value from `oXX.count()`. This \"exception str() failed\" often means the Java side threw an exception (like OOM) and the message itself couldn't be properly serialized back to Python.
2.  This is then wrapped in a `ConnectionResetError` or `Py4JNetworkError` because the communication channel to the (likely crashed) JVM is broken.
3.  Finally, a `ConnectionRefusedError` when Py4J tries to re-establish a connection to a non-responsive JVM.

**Cause:**
The operation `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.transform(test_df)` creates the `final_predictions_rf_tuned` DataFrame. This DataFrame is lazy. Then, `final_predictions_rf_tuned.persist()` tells Spark to cache it, and `final_predictions_rf_tuned.count()` forces its materialization.

Even though `test_df` is smaller (~2.5 million rows), the `transform` operation itself (applying the assembler, scaler, and the full Random Forest model) can be memory intensive. If the resulting `final_predictions_rf_tuned` DataFrame (which includes original columns + features + probability vector + prediction) is too large to cache, or if the transformation process itself exhausts memory, the Spark JVM crashes.

The print statement \"Making predictions with the FINAL Tuned Random Forest on test data...\" executed, but the crash happened right after, during the `persist()` and `count()` on the predictions.

**What to Do (This is becoming a pattern of hitting Colab's resource limits):**

We are consistently hitting memory limits when trying to perform actions (like `count()` or `persist()`) on large DataFrames or after complex transformations, even if the *input* DataFrames (`train_df`, `test_df`) were successfully loaded and persisted.

1.  **Restart Kernel:** Always the first step after such a crash.
2.  **Re-run Prerequisite Cells (Carefully):**
    *   Cell 1 (Setup - with reduced shuffle partitions if you added that).
    *   Cell 2 (Load ABT - *light version*, just define `abt_df` for schema).
    *   Cell 3 (Target & Features).
    *   Cell 4 (Data Splitting - ensure `train_df.parquet`, `test_df.parquet` are on disk).
    *   Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup - loads `train_df`, `test_df` from disk and *persists* them. **This persist is important for the next step**).

3.  **Modify Cell 8 (Tuned RF) - Focus on Reducing Memory During Prediction & Evaluation:**
    *   The tuning part on the sample completed. The problem is training the final model on full data AND then immediately transforming and persisting the full test set predictions.
    *   **Strategy for Cell 8:**
        *   Train the final model: `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned = final_pipeline_rf_obj.fit(training_data_for_final_rf)`.
        *   **Do NOT immediately persist `final_predictions_rf_tuned`**.
        *   Calculate evaluation metrics one by one, or in smaller groups, allowing Spark to recompute `final_predictions_rf_tuned` if necessary or stream through it. While less efficient, it's more memory-friendly than a full persist of a wide DataFrame.
        *   Alternatively, after `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.transform(test_df)`, immediately select *only the necessary columns* for evaluation (`TARGET_COL`, `probability`, `prediction`) before any action or persist.

**Key Changes in this \"Lighter Evaluation\" attempt for Cell 8:**

1.  **Selective Prediction Columns:** After `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.transform(test_df)` produces `predictions_base_df`, we immediately do:
    ```python
    predictions_for_eval_df = predictions_base_df.select(
        TARGET_COL, 
        \"probability\", 
        \"prediction\"
    )
    ```
    This creates a much narrower DataFrame (`predictions_for_eval_df`) containing only the columns essential for evaluation.
2.  **Persist Narrower DataFrame:** `predictions_for_eval_df.persist()` is called on this narrower DataFrame. This has a much higher chance of succeeding in memory.
3.  **All Evaluations Use `predictions_for_eval_df`:** All subsequent metric calculations use this smaller, persisted DataFrame.

**Execution Plan:**
1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Re-run Cells 1, (part of 2 for `abt_df` definition for schema), 3, 4, 5.**
3.  **SKIP Cell 6 (LR) and Cell 7 (Initial RF).**
4.  **Run this latest \"Revised Cell 8\" with the lighter evaluation strategy.**

This focuses on reducing the memory pressure *after* the model is trained and during the prediction and evaluation phase on the test set. The training of `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` on the full `train_df` is still the heaviest part. If that part completes, this lighter evaluation has a good chance.

If OOM *still* occurs during `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.fit(training_data_for_final_rf)`, then the issue is purely with training the RF of that complexity (`numTrees`, `maxDepth`) on 30M rows with 78 features within Colab's RAM. In that scenario, the only remaining options would be:
*   Further reduce `numTrees` or `maxDepth` for the *final* model.
*   Train the final model on a (larger) sample of `train_df` instead of the full set.
*   Conclude that training this specific RF configuration on the full dataset is infeasible in the current environment and rely on the model tuned and trained on the smaller sample (from the first part of Cell 8)."""),

*   AUC-ROC: 0.9893
*   AUC-PR: 0.7230
*   Recall (Class 1): 0.7110
*   Precision (Class 1): 0.6385

That successful run means:
1.  The **tuning on the sample completed.**
2.  The **final Random Forest model trained on the full `train_df` with the best parameters also completed.**
3.  The **predictions on `test_df` were made (`final_predictions_rf_tuned`).**
4.  The **evaluations were calculated.**

The OOM error you posted (`An error occurred while calling o869.count`) happened when it tried to materialize `final_predictions_rf_tuned` *after* all the above had successfully run, specifically at the line:
`classified_abt_count = final_classified_abt_df.count()` from **Cell 13 (Excel Classification)**, which was trying to read the output of Cell 12.

And the error before that (`ConnectionRefusedError` while reading in Cell 13) was due to the Spark session dying *after* Cell 12 completed writing the final ABT.

**This means the core model training and evaluation in Cell 8 (the one that produced the good RF results) was successful!** The issue was trying to load and process the *entire, very wide ABT* from Cell 12 in Cell 13, or the Spark session dying between cells.

**Let's reset our focus based on this critical piece of information.**

**Current State (Based on your successful Cell 8 output):**

*   You have successfully run up to the end of Cell 8 (the version that did subsampling for tuning, then trained a final RF model on full data, and evaluated it).
*   The variables `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`, `final_predictions_rf_tuned`, and all the metric variables (e.g., `roc_auc_final_rf`, `recall_class1_final_rf`, etc.) were populated *in that session*.
*   **The crucial missing step was saving the `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` object itself at the end of that successful Cell 8 run.**

**Plan Now (to get to Cells 10, 11, 12, 13 without re-doing the 3.5-hour Cell 8 training):**

Since the model training *was* successful, but the *model object* might be lost if the kernel restarted, our best bet is:

1.  **If you still have the Colab session open where Cell 8 successfully completed and all the Python variables are still live:**
    *   Immediately run **Cell 10 (Save Best Tuned RF Model & Metrics)** as provided before. This will save `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` to disk and also the metrics.
    *   Then proceed to Cell 11 (Feature Importance), Cell 12 (Threshold), Cell 13 (Summary).

2.  **If the Colab session was restarted after Cell 8 completed (most likely scenario):**
    *   The `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` object is lost.
    *   The `final_predictions_rf_tuned` DataFrame object is lost.
    *   The Python metric variables are lost.
    *   **In this case, you unfortunately DO have to re-run parts of Cell 8 to recreate `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` and `final_predictions_rf_tuned`.**
    *   However, you **DO NOT** need to re-run the `TrainValidationSplit` part (the `tvs_model_rf_on_sample = train_validation_split_rf.fit(sampled_train_df)`). You know the `best_params_from_sample` from your previous output.

**Modified approach if Session was Restarted (Focus on re-training ONLY the final best model from Cell 8):**

1.  **Restart Kernel (if not already done).**
2.  **Run Cell 1 (Setup).**
3.  **Run Cell 2 (Load ABT - light version for schema).**
4.  **Run Cell 3 (Target & Features).**
5.  **Run Cell 4 (Data Splitting - ensure `train_df.parquet`, `test_df.parquet` are on disk/paths set).**
6.  **Run Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup - loads train/test from disk, persists them, defines `pipeline` which gives `assembler_stage` and `scaler_stage`).**
7.  **SKIP Cells 6 (LR), 7 (Initial RF).**
8.  **Run a MODIFIED Cell 8 that SKIPS THE TUNING PART and directly trains the final RF model with the known best parameters.**

**Action Plan (If Session was Restarted After Successful Cell 8 Run):**

1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Run Cell 1.**
3.  **Run Cell 2 (Light version - just define `abt_df` for schema for Cell 3).**
4.  **Run Cell 3 (Defines `TARGET_COL`, `feature_columns`).**
5.  **Run Cell 4 (Defines train/test paths, writes Parquet files if not present or overwrites).**
6.  **Run Cell 5 (Loads `train_df`, `test_df` from disk, persists them, defines `pipeline` object).**
7.  **SKIP Cell 6 (LR), SKIP Cell 7 (Initial RF).**
8.  **Run this new \"Modified Cell 8 (Re-train FINAL Best RF Model ONLY...)\"**.
    *   **Manually update** the `best_numTrees`, `best_maxDepth`, etc. at the top of this cell with the values you saw in your previous successful Cell 8 output.
    *   This will re-train only *one* RF model on the full training data. This should be significantly faster than the full tuning process but still might take 1-2 hours given previous timings for the final model training.
9.  **Then, proceed to Cell 10 (which will now be renamed or just use the variables), 11, 12, 13.** The \"Save Model & Metrics\" logic is now *inside* this modified Cell 8.

This approach saves you the ~1-1.5 hours of the subsample tuning part of Cell 8 if you already know the best parameters. The main time sink will be re-fitting the final RF model on the full `train_df`."""),

**Execution Plan (Option 1 - Re-running this \"Modified Cell 8\"):**

1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Run Cell 1 (Setup).**
3.  **Run Cell 2 (Load ABT - light version: `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)` and `abt_df.printSchema()`. Comment out persist/count/describe on the full `abt_df`).**
4.  **Run Cell 3 (Target & Features - defines `TARGET_COL=\"Is_Churned_Engage_270Days\"`, `feature_columns`).**
5.  **Run Cell 4 (Data Splitting - make sure `train_df_path`, `test_df_path` are correct, it will overwrite existing Parquet files).**
6.  **Run Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup - loads `train_df`, `test_df` from disk, persists them, defines `pipeline` object for assembler/scaler).**
7.  **SKIP Cell 6 (LR), SKIP Cell 7 (Initial RF if you had one).**
8.  **Run this new \"Finalized Modified Cell 8\".**
    *   This will re-train *only one* RF model on the full training data using the known best parameters. This should take roughly the time it took for the \"Fitting FINAL Random Forest pipeline on FULL training data...\" part of your previous successful Cell 8 run (likely 1-2.5 hours, a fraction of the full 3.5 hours that included tuning).
    *   It will then evaluate and **save the model.**

After this \"Finalized Modified Cell 8\" completes and saves the model, you can then proceed to:
*   **Cell 10 (which was \"Save Model & Metrics\"):** You can adapt this cell to primarily save the *metrics* that were just re-calculated by this modified Cell 8, as the model is already saved. Or, if you want a separate cell just for metric saving, that's fine too. The important part is that `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` and the metric variables like `roc_auc_final_rf` are now live in your session.
*   **Cell 11 (Feature Importances):** This will use `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`.
*   **Cell 12 (Threshold Adjustment):** This will use `final_predictions_rf_tuned` (which was persisted and then unpersisted, so for Cell 12, you might need to regenerate it or load the model and transform `test_df` again if `final_predictions_rf_tuned` is not available).
*   **Cell 13 (Summary).**

This is the most efficient way to get back to a state where you have your best RF model and its predictions/metrics available without re-doing the lengthy tuning."""),

1.  **`final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` was successfully saved to disk** at the specified path:
    `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/best_rf_pipeline_model_Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`
2.  **Key performance metrics were successfully saved to a JSON file:**
    `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/metrics_summary_rf_Is_Churned_Engage_270Days.json`

This is excellent because it means:
*   You now have a persistent copy of your best performing model (the tuned Random Forest pipeline for `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`). If your Colab session restarts, you can **load this saved model directly** instead of re-training it from scratch, which will save a lot of time.
*   You have a record of its performance metrics.

**Next Steps:**

You are now in a great position to proceed with the subsequent analysis cells, knowing that the core model artifact is safe.

1.  **Cell 11 (Analyze Feature Importances):**
    *   This cell should work as previously defined. It will use the `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` Python object (which is currently live in your session after running the modified Cell 8 and then Cell 10) to extract feature importances.
    *   If you were to restart the session *now* and wanted to run Cell 11, you would first need to load the saved model (from `best_rf_model_save_path`) into `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`.

2.  **Cell 12 (Optional - Adjust Prediction Threshold):**
    *   This cell uses `final_predictions_rf_tuned` (the DataFrame with predictions on the test set).
    *   In the \"Finalized Modified Cell 8\", `final_predictions_rf_tuned` was persisted, used for evaluations, and then unpersisted at the very end of that cell block.
    *   **Therefore, for Cell 12 to work now, `final_predictions_rf_tuned` needs to be available.**
    *   You have two options if `final_predictions_rf_tuned` is no longer cached/available:
        *   **Option A (Re-generate predictions - Recommended if session is fresh and `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` is live):**
            ```python
            # At the beginning of Cell 12, if final_predictions_rf_tuned is not available
            if 'final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned' in locals() and 'test_df' in locals() and test_df.is_cached:
                print(\"Re-generating predictions for threshold tuning...\")
                final_predictions_rf_tuned = final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.transform(test_df)
                final_predictions_rf_tuned.persist() # Persist for use within this cell
                final_predictions_rf_tuned.count() # Action to materialize
            else:
                print(\"ERROR: Cannot re-generate predictions for threshold tuning. Model or test_df not available.\")
                # raise Exception(...)
            ```
        *   **Option B (If you had also saved `final_predictions_rf_tuned` to disk):** Load it. (But we didn't explicitly save this DataFrame).

3.  **Cell 13 (Summary):**
    *   This cell uses the Python variables holding the metrics (e.g., `roc_auc_final_rf`, `recall_class1_final_rf`). These should still be live in your current session if Cell 8 and Cell 10 just ran.

**Let's proceed with Cell 11 (Feature Importances).** It should use the `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` that is currently in your session's memory.

No code changes should be needed for Cell 11 based on the previous version."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""This is excellent! The feature importance plot and the corresponding table from Cell 11 provide very valuable insights into what your best Random Forest model (for `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`) considers important for making predictions.

**Analysis of Feature Importances:**

1.  **Login Activity Dominance (Especially Longer-Term):**
    *   **Top 2 Features:** `Login_Txns_Count_270D` (importance ~0.145) and `Login_Days_Count_270D` (importance ~0.113) are by far the most influential. This strongly suggests that the frequency and consistency of logins over a long period (270 days) leading up to the snapshot are primary indicators of future engagement or churn.
    *   `Login_Days_Count_90D` and `Days_Since_Last_Login` also appear in the top 4, reinforcing the importance of login recency and shorter-term login frequency.
    *   `Login_Days_Count_365D` and `Login_Txns_Count_365D` also feature prominently.
    *   **Insight:** Clients who maintain a high and consistent login frequency over extended periods are less likely to churn. A drop in this is a major warning sign.

2.  **Trade Activity Importance (Also Longer-Term):**
    *   `Trade_Txns_Count_270D` and `Trade_Days_Count_270D` are in the top 7. Similar to logins, the volume and consistency of trading over a longer period are key.
    *   `Days_Since_Last_Trade` is also quite important, indicating trade recency matters.
    *   `Trade_Sum_270D` and `Trade_Sum_365D` (brokerage generated) show that monetary value from trading is a factor, though perhaps slightly less dominant than the raw frequency of trading/logging in for this model.

3.  **Recency is Key:**
    *   `Days_Since_Last_Login` and `Days_Since_Last_Trade` are both in the top 10. This is intuitive: the longer it has been since a client last interacted in these key ways, the higher their churn risk.
    *   Interestingly, `Days_Since_Last_Payout` appears in the top 20. A recent large payout could be a signal, or simply any recent payout might correlate with disengagement planning.

4.  **Monetary and Value Metrics:**
    *   `Trade_Sum_270D` and `Trade_Sum_365D` (brokerage) are important.
    *   `AUM_SnapshotMonth_RunningTotal` also makes the top list. This suggests that clients with a higher overall accumulated AUM might have different churn characteristics.

5.  **Shorter-Term vs. Longer-Term Lookbacks:**
    *   While shorter-term lookbacks for login/trade frequency (e.g., `_30D`, `_90D`) are present, the longer-term ones ( `_270D`, `_365D`) for login and trade frequency/transactions appear to have more overall importance for predicting 270-day churn. This makes sense – predicting longer-term churn often benefits from observing longer-term behavior patterns.

6.  **`Login_Txns_Count` vs. `Login_Days_Count`:**
    *   For the 270D lookback, `Login_Txns_Count_270D` is more important than `Login_Days_Count_270D`. This might suggest that the sheer volume of interactions (multiple logins on the same day count towards Txns) is slightly more indicative than just the number of unique days they logged in over that long period.

**Business Implications & Actions Based on These Importances:**

*   **Monitor Login Behavior Closely:** Significant drops in long-term login frequency or a client becoming very login-recedent are strong red flags.
*   **Track Trading Consistency:** Similar to logins, sustained trading activity is a sign of engagement.
*   **Early Warning for Recency:** Trigger alerts or attention if `Days_Since_Last_Login` or `Days_Since_Last_Trade` cross certain thresholds.
*   **AUM as a Stickiness Factor:** Clients with higher running AUM might be more \"sticky,\" but this needs to be seen in conjunction with their activity.
*   **Payouts:** While `Days_Since_Last_Payout` is at the bottom of this top 20, it's worth noting. The `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance` and `Payout_Risk_Flag` features we added to the ABT (but excluded from this initial model run for simplicity) might be very powerful if included and should be tested.

**Regarding the `FutureWarning` for `sns.barplot`:**
This is a common warning from Seaborn. It's just an advisory about future API changes. The plot was still generated correctly. The suggestion is to use `hue='feature'` (or `hue='y'` if y is the feature column) and `legend=False` for the same visual effect in future Seaborn versions if you want the palette to map to the y-axis categories. For now, it's not a critical issue.

**Conclusion for Cell 11:**
This is a very insightful set of feature importances. It clearly points towards **sustained engagement, particularly in terms of login and trade frequency over longer periods (270-365 days), and recency of these activities, as the primary drivers for the 270-day churn model.**

You have successfully identified key behavioral indicators!

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Cell 12 (Optional - Adjust Prediction Threshold):** You can now run this cell to see if you can fine-tune the balance of precision and recall for the churner class by changing the prediction threshold from the default 0.5. This is particularly relevant since your recall for churners (0.7110) is good, but there's always a trade-off with precision (0.6385).
2.  **Cell 13 (Summary):** To get a clean printout of the best model's performance.
3.  **Iterate for Other Target Variables:** This is a key next step. You would:
    *   Go back to Cell 3.
    *   Change `TARGET_COL` to, for example, `\"Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\"`.
    *   Re-run Cell 3 (to update `feature_columns` to exclude the new target and include the old one).
    *   Re-run Cell 5 (to ensure `train_df` and `test_df` are correctly prepared for the new target, though they are loaded from disk, the `TARGET_COL` is used by models).
    *   Re-run Cell 8 (or the \"Modified Cell 8\" that just re-trains the final model with known best params, if you want to assume params generalize, or re-do tuning on a sample for the new target).
    *   Re-run Cell 10 (Save model/metrics for the new target).
    *   Re-run Cell 11 (Feature importances for the new target).
    *   Re-run Cell 12 & 13.

This iterative process will give you a tuned model for each of your churn windows."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""This output from Cell 12 (Threshold Adjustment) is fantastic and very insightful! The plot and the table clearly show the trade-off between precision and recall for the churner class (Class 1) as you vary the prediction threshold.

**Analysis of Threshold Adjustment Results:**

1.  **Standard Trade-off Visible:**
    *   As you **decrease the threshold** (e.g., from 0.5 down to 0.1):
        *   **Recall (Class 1) increases significantly:** The model becomes more sensitive and identifies more of the actual churners (catches almost all at threshold 0.1 - Recall ~0.98).
        *   **Precision (Class 1) decreases significantly:** The model makes more False Positive errors (flags more non-churners as churners). At threshold 0.1, precision is ~0.39.
    *   As you **increase the threshold** (e.g., from 0.5 up to 0.9):
        *   **Recall (Class 1) decreases dramatically:** The model becomes very conservative and misses most of the actual churners (Recall is almost 0 at threshold 0.9).
        *   **Precision (Class 1) increases significantly:** When the model *does* predict churn at a high threshold, it's much more likely to be correct (Precision ~0.90 at threshold 0.8).

2.  **F1-Score (Class 1) Peak:**
    *   The F1-score for Class 1 (churners) is a balance between precision and recall.
    *   Looking at your table and plot:
        *   Threshold 0.10: F1(C1) = 0.5565
        *   Threshold 0.20: F1(C1) = 0.6147
        *   Threshold 0.30: F1(C1) = 0.6506
        *   **Threshold 0.40: F1(C1) = 0.6743 (Highest in this set)**
        *   **Threshold 0.50: F1(C1) = 0.6728 (Default, very close to 0.40)**
        *   Threshold 0.60: F1(C1) = 0.6312
    *   The F1-score peaks around a threshold of **0.40** (0.6743), closely followed by the default 0.50 (0.6728). This suggests that slightly lowering the threshold from 0.5 to 0.4 could give a marginally better balance of precision and recall *if F1-score for churners is your primary optimization metric.*

3.  **Impact on Accuracy:**
    *   Overall accuracy changes, but not as dramatically as precision/recall for the minority class. It hovers around 0.95 to 0.979. This highlights why accuracy alone is not a good metric for imbalanced datasets. The highest accuracy is around threshold 0.60 (0.9791).

**How to Use This Information (Choosing an Optimal Threshold):**

The \"best\" threshold depends entirely on the **business objective and the relative costs of False Positives vs. False Negatives.**

*   **If Minimizing Missed Churners is Critical (High Recall for Class 1 is Key):**
    *   You might choose a lower threshold, e.g., **0.20 or 0.30**.
    *   At threshold 0.30: Recall = 0.8846 (catch ~88% of churners), Precision = 0.5146 (when you predict churn, you're right ~51% of the time). F1 = 0.6506.
    *   This means you'll contact more clients (including more non-churners) but miss fewer actual churners.

*   **If Minimizing Wasted Effort on Non-Churners is Critical (High Precision for Class 1 is Key):**
    *   You might choose a higher threshold, e.g., **0.60 or 0.70**.
    *   At threshold 0.60: Recall = 0.5699 (catch ~57% of churners), Precision = 0.7074 (when you predict churn, you're right ~71% of the time). F1 = 0.6312.
    *   At threshold 0.70: Recall = 0.3045 (catch only ~30% of churners), Precision = 0.8339 (very high precision).
    *   This means you'll contact fewer clients, be more accurate with those you contact, but miss a larger portion of actual churners.

*   **If Balancing Precision and Recall is Desired (Maximize F1-Score for Class 1):**
    *   A threshold around **0.40** (F1 ~0.6743, Recall ~0.80, Precision ~0.58) or **0.50** (F1 ~0.6728, Recall ~0.71, Precision ~0.64) seems optimal from an F1 perspective.
    *   The default threshold of 0.50 (used by the `.prediction` column) already gives a very good F1 for Class 1. Lowering it slightly to 0.4 might give a small F1 boost by increasing recall more than it hurts precision.

**Decision for Your Model:**

*   The default threshold of 0.5 gave: Recall (C1) = 0.7110, Precision (C1) = 0.6385.
*   At threshold 0.4: Recall (C1) = 0.8035, Precision (C1) = 0.5808.
*   You gain about 9% in recall (catch more churners) by lowering the threshold to 0.4, at the cost of a ~5.7% drop in precision (more false alarms).

This is a business decision. For many churn models, getting a higher recall (identifying more true churners) is often prioritized, even if it means a slightly lower precision, as long as the precision is still acceptable.

**Conclusion for Cell 12:**
This threshold analysis is very valuable. It shows you have flexibility in how you use the model's probability scores. You can choose a threshold that aligns best with Religare's business strategy for handling potential churners. The default 0.5 is already quite good, but 0.4 offers higher recall for a modest precision trade-off, maximizing F1.

Now you are ready for Cell 13 (Summarize Model Performance). You can include the performance at your chosen \"optimal\" threshold in that summary if you decide to use something other than 0.5."""),

**Summary of Key Performance Metrics (Tuned RF, Target: Is_Churned_Engage_270Days, Threshold 0.5):**

*   **AUC-ROC: 0.9893** (Excellent discrimination)
*   **AUC-PR: 0.7230** (Very good for imbalanced data, indicating good precision-recall balance for churners)
*   **Overall Accuracy: 0.9782** (High, but always consider in context of imbalance)
*   **Weighted F1-Score: 0.9788** (Excellent overall F1)

*   **For Churners (Class 1):**
    *   **Recall (Sensitivity): 0.7110** (The model identifies 71.1% of actual churners)
    *   **Precision: 0.6385** (When the model predicts churn, it is correct 63.85% of the time)
    *   **F1-Score (calculated for Class 1): 0.6728** (Good balance for the churner class)

*   **Confusion Matrix Components:**
    *   TP: 56,483 (Correctly identified churners)
    *   FP: 31,977 (Non-churners flagged as churners)
    *   FN: 22,957 (Actual churners missed by the model)
    *   TN: 2,414,254 (Correctly identified non-churners)

**This is a strong set of results for your churn prediction model.** You have a model that:
*   Is highly discriminative (AUC-ROC).
*   Performs well on the imbalanced churn class (AUC-PR, F1 for Class 1).
*   Identifies a good majority of actual churners (Recall ~71%).
*   Is reasonably precise when it predicts churn (Precision ~64%).

**What This Means for the Business (Religare):**

*   You can identify roughly 7 out of 10 clients who are on track to churn within 270 days (based on the definition of no trades AND no logins after recent engagement).
*   When the model flags a client as a potential churner, there's a ~64% chance they actually will churn according to this definition. This is a good enough precision to warrant targeted retention efforts, as the cost of intervention might be less than the cost of losing 64% of those flagged clients.
*   The number of False Positives (31,977) represents the clients who would receive unnecessary retention efforts. The business needs to weigh the cost of these efforts against the value of retaining the True Positives.
*   The number of False Negatives (22,957) represents churners the model will miss.

**Next Steps (As Indicated by Your Cell 13 Output):**

1.  **Document These Results:** Make sure these final metrics for the `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` target are well-documented. This is your benchmark.

2.  **Consider the Optimal Threshold:** Based on Cell 12, if the business prefers higher recall (e.g., catching ~80% of churners) and can tolerate a precision of ~58%, you might decide to use a threshold of 0.4 operationally and document the metrics for that threshold. For now, the summary above is for the default 0.5.

3.  **Iterate for Other Target Variables:** This is the main next action.
    *   Go back to **Cell 3**.
    *   Change `TARGET_COL`. For example:
        ```python
        TARGET_COL = \"Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\" 
        # Or \"Is_Churned_Engage_60Days\" or \"Is_Churned_Engage_365Days\"
        ```
    *   **Re-run the necessary cells:**
        *   **Cell 3** (to update `TARGET_COL` and `feature_columns`).
        *   **Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup):** This will:
            *   Load `train_df` and `test_df` (which are generic and don't change based on target).
            *   Crucially, the `LogisticRegression`, `RandomForestClassifier` etc. defined within pipeline stages will now use the *new* `TARGET_COL` because the `labelCol` parameter in their definition points to the `TARGET_COL` variable.
        *   **Cell 6 (Logistic Regression):** Train and evaluate LR for the new target.
        *   **SKIP Cell 7 (Initial RF).**
        *   **Modified Cell 8 (Re-train FINAL Best RF Model ONLY...):**
            *   This cell will re-train a Random Forest model using the *same best hyperparameters* found for the 270D target (numTrees=50, maxDepth=10 etc.). This is a common approach to save time: assume good hyperparameters might generalize.
            *   Alternatively, if you have a lot of time, you could re-run the full tuning process (the original Cell 8 logic) for each new target, but it would be very time-consuming. Starting with the previously found best RF params is a good first step for other targets.
            *   This cell will also save the new model (e.g., `best_rf_pipeline_model_Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`).
        *   **Cell 10 (Save Metrics - now part of Modified Cell 8):** Will save metrics for the new target.
        *   **Cell 11 (Feature Importances):** Will show importances for the new target.
        *   **Cell 12 (Threshold Adjustment - Optional):** For the new target.
        *   **Cell 13 (Summary):** For the new target.

By iterating this way, you will have a set of well-performing Random Forest models, one for each of your churn prediction windows (60D, 90D, 270D, 365D), along with their performance characteristics. This provides a comprehensive view of churn predictability at different horizons."""),

The \"better\" `TARGET_COL` (i.e., churn window: 60, 90, 270, or 365 days) depends heavily on **Religare's specific business objectives, intervention capabilities, and the costs associated with churn vs. retention efforts.**

There's no single \"best\" for all situations. Here's a breakdown to help you (or Religare) decide, or how to present the options:

**Factors to Consider When Choosing a Target Churn Window:**

1.  **Actionability & Intervention Timeframe:**
    *   **Shorter Windows (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_60Days`, `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`):**
        *   **Pros:** Allows for *quicker intervention*. If you can predict a client is likely to become inactive in the next 2-3 months, you have a timely opportunity to re-engage them before they drift too far. Useful for tactical campaigns.
        *   **Cons:** Might capture more \"soft churn\" or temporary disengagement. Clients might naturally have short breaks. Intervening too aggressively might be unnecessary or even annoying for some. The definition of \"recently active\" (Condition A) being tied to the same window length helps mitigate this a bit.
        *   **Business Use:** Good for \"early warning systems\" and triggering quick, light-touch re-engagement efforts.
    *   **Longer Windows (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`, `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days`):**
        *   **Pros:** Represents a more \"confirmed\" or \"hard\" churn. Clients inactive for 9-12 months are likely truly disengaged. Predictions here help understand long-term attrition and identify clients needing more significant win-back strategies (if feasible) or for strategic resource allocation.
        *   **Cons:** The prediction is further out. By the time the model predicts this, the client might already be significantly disengaged, making intervention harder or less effective.
        *   **Business Use:** Good for strategic planning, understanding deep-seated churn reasons, and possibly high-effort win-back campaigns for high-value clients.

2.  **Model Performance & Predictability:**
    *   Sometimes, it's easier to predict shorter-term behavior or longer-term entrenched behavior. The \"middle ground\" can sometimes be noisier.
    *   You'll see this when you train models for each window. One window might yield a model with significantly better AUC-PR or a better precision/recall balance for your needs.
    *   The feature importances might also differ, giving insights into what drives short-term vs. long-term disengagement.

3.  **Cost of False Positives vs. False Negatives:**
    *   **False Positive (FP):** Predicting a client will churn, but they don't.
        *   *Cost:* Wasted retention effort/budget, potentially annoying a happy client.
    *   **False Negative (FN):** Predicting a client will *not* churn, but they do.
        *   *Cost:* Lost client, lost future revenue, cost of acquiring a new client to replace them (often high).
    *   If FNs are very costly, a model with higher recall (even if for a shorter window, allowing earlier intervention) might be preferred.
    *   If retention efforts are expensive, higher precision is desired.
    *   The threshold analysis (Cell 12) helps manage this trade-off for any chosen window.

4.  **Nature of \"Churn\" for Religare:**
    *   What does Religare *consider* a truly lost client for whom standard re-engagement is no longer the primary approach? This internal business definition might align more with one of the longer windows.
    *   However, the business might also want an *early warning* for clients *at risk* of reaching that state, which points to shorter windows.

**Recommendations & How to Decide:**

1.  **Model for All Windows (as planned):** Your current plan to build models for 60D, 90D, 270D, and 365D is the best approach. This gives you a full spectrum of insights.

2.  **Present Results for All Models:** Show the business stakeholders the performance (AUC-PR, Recall for churners, Precision for churners, F1 for churners) for each model (e.g., the best tuned RF for each window).

3.  **Discuss with Business Stakeholders:** This is crucial. Present the findings:
    *   \"Our 90-day model can predict clients who will go silent for the next 3 months with X% recall and Y% precision.\"
    *   \"Our 270-day model can predict clients who will go silent for the next 9 months with A% recall and B% precision.\"
    *   **Ask them:**
        *   \"Which prediction horizon is most actionable for your current retention strategies?\"
        *   \"What's the typical lead time you need to effectively intervene?\"
        *   \"What's the acceptable rate of contacting non-churners (related to precision)?\"
        *   \"What's the acceptable rate of missing actual churners (related to recall)?\"

4.  **Consider a \"Tiered\" Approach:**
    *   It's possible Religare might want to use *multiple* models.
    *   **Example:** Use the 90-day model for broad, automated, low-cost re-engagement nudges. Use the 270-day model (which might have different feature drivers or higher precision after threshold tuning) to identify clients for more intensive, personalized outreach by a retention team.

5.  **Analyze Feature Importances for Each Window:**
    *   The drivers for 60-day churn might be different from 365-day churn. This itself is a valuable business insight.

**If I had to pick one to *start* with or one that often provides a good balance for proactive retention:**

*   The **`Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`** window is often a good sweet spot.
    *   It's far enough out to represent a significant lapse in activity (especially given your inter-trade time EDA).
    *   It's still short enough that interventions might be effective.
    *   It often has a reasonable number of churn events for modeling.

*   The **`Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`** (which you've just successfully modeled) is also excellent for a more \"confirmed\" churn state that likely requires a different type of intervention.

**Ultimately, the \"better\" `TARGET_COL` is the one (or ones) that provides the most *valuable and actionable insights* for Religare's specific business goals and operational capabilities.** Your job as a data scientist is to provide them with the performance characteristics of models for each window so they can make an informed decision."""),

Here's the sequence of operations to switch to and model for this new target:

**Sequence for Modeling `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`:**

1.  **Restart Kernel (Recommended for a Clean Slate):**
    *   Since we're changing the `TARGET_COL`, it's good practice to restart the kernel to ensure no variables or states from the previous target's modeling run interfere.
    *   \"Runtime\" -> \"Restart runtime...\"

2.  **Re-run Initial Setup and Data Loading Cells:**
    *   **Cell 1 (Setup):** Re-initialize SparkSession, mount Drive, define paths.
    *   **Cell 2 (Load ABT - Light Version):**
        *   Run `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)`
        *   Run `abt_df.printSchema()` (to ensure `abt_df` is defined for Cell 3).
        *   You can comment out other actions in Cell 2 like `count()` or `describe()` on the full `abt_df` to save time/memory.
    *   **Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection and Feature Definition):**
        *   **CRITICAL CHANGE HERE:** Modify `TARGET_COL`:
            ```python
            TARGET_COL = \"Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\" 
            ```
        *   Re-run the rest of Cell 3. This will update the `TARGET_COL` variable and regenerate the `feature_columns` list, correctly excluding the new target and other churn labels.
    *   **Cell 4 (Data Splitting - Time-Based, writing to disk):**
        *   Re-run this cell. It will use the same `SPLIT_DATE_STR`. The `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` files will be overwritten. This is fine as they are generic; the target column within them will be selected later by the models.
    *   **Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup):**
        *   Re-run this cell. It will:
            *   Load `train_df` and `test_df` from disk.
            *   Persist them.
            *   Define the `pipeline` object. **Crucially, the `LogisticRegression` (and later `RandomForestClassifier`, `GBTClassifier`) stages within this pipeline will now use `labelCol=TARGET_COL` which now points to `\"Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\"`.**

3.  **Re-run Model Training and Evaluation Cells (for the new 90D target):**

    *   **Cell 6 (Train Logistic Regression Model and Initial Evaluation):**
        *   Run this to get a baseline for the 90-day target. The class weighting will automatically adjust based on the distribution of `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days` in `train_df`.

    *   **SKIP Cell 7 (Initial Random Forest - if you went straight to tuned RF before).**

    *   **Cell 8 (Hyperparameter Tuning for Random Forest - Subsampling, Full Train, SAVE):**
        *   This is the long cell. It will now tune and train a Random Forest model to predict `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`.
        *   It will use the same hyperparameter grid (the \"small\" one) and subsampling strategy.
        *   **Important:** The model saved at the end of this cell will now be specific to the 90D target. Modify the save path accordingly:
            ```python
            # In the \"SAVE THE BEST TUNED PIPELINE MODEL\" part of Cell 8
            best_rf_model_save_path = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, f\"best_rf_pipeline_model_{TARGET_COL}\") 
            # This will now correctly save as \"..._Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\"
            ```

4.  **Re-run Post-Modeling Analysis Cells (for the new 90D target):**

    *   **Cell 10 (Save Best Tuned Random Forest Model & Metrics - now integrated into Cell 8):** The saving logic is already in the \"Finalized Modified Cell 8\". Ensure the metrics file also reflects the new target:
        ```python
        # In the \"Save the Metrics\" part of Cell 10 (or now end of Cell 8)
        metrics_file_path = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, f\"metrics_summary_rf_{TARGET_COL}.json\")
        ```

    *   **Cell 11 (Analyze Feature Importances):** This will show feature importances for the 90-day churn model.

    *   **Cell 12 (Optional - Adjust Prediction Threshold):** Explore thresholds for the 90-day model.

    *   **Cell 13 (Summarize Model Performance):** Summarize results for the 90-day model.

**Action Plan Summary:**

1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Run Cell 1.**
3.  **Run Cell 2 (light - for `abt_df` definition).**
4.  **Modify `TARGET_COL` in Cell 3 to `\"Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\"` and run Cell 3.**
5.  **Run Cell 4.**
6.  **Run Cell 5.**
7.  **Run Cell 6 (Logistic Regression for 90D).**
8.  **Run the \"Finalized Modified Cell 8\" (RF Tuning & Final Model Training for 90D).** This will be the long step.
9.  **Run Cell 11 (Feature Importances for 90D).**
10. **Run Cell 12 (Optional - Thresholds for 90D).**
11. **Run Cell 13 (Summary for 90D).**

This provides a clean, iterative workflow. You'll get a full set of results and a saved model specifically for the 90-day churn prediction task. Good luck!"""),

So, after completing the modeling cycle (up to saving the best model, its metrics, and analyzing feature importances) for the **`Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`** target, you want to consider that the primary modeling phase for *this iteration* of the project is complete, and you don't need to immediately model for the 60D or 365D windows.

That's a perfectly valid stopping point for a modeling iteration. You will have:

1.  A well-performing model for **270-day churn** (from the previous runs).
2.  A well-performing model for **90-day churn** (from the upcoming run).
3.  Insights into feature importances and performance characteristics for both.

**Next Steps in the Project (After Modeling for 90D and 270D is Done):**

Here's a logical progression for what to do next:

1.  **Consolidate and Document Findings:**
    *   **Model Performance Comparison:** Create a clear table or report comparing the final performance metrics (AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, Recall for Churners, Precision for Churners, F1 for Churners) of the best models for both the 90-day and 270-day targets.
    *   **Feature Importance Comparison:** Compare the top feature importances for the 90-day model vs. the 270-day model. Are there differences? Do short-term churn drivers differ from longer-term ones? This is valuable business insight.
    *   **Threshold Analysis Summary:** Summarize the findings from the threshold adjustment (Cell 12) for both models. What are the trade-offs at different thresholds? What threshold might be recommended for each based on potential business objectives?
    *   **Document Assumptions and Limitations:** Note any proxies used (e.g., 12M data for 36M Excel logic), data limitations, or aspects of the model that need further investigation.

2.  **Prepare for \"Deployment\" or \"Operationalization\" (Conceptual):**
    Even if not a full production deployment, think about how these models would be used:
    *   **Scoring Pipeline:** How would you take new client data (as of a current date) and run it through the saved model pipeline to get churn probabilities? This involves replicating the feature engineering steps from the ABT generation on new data.
    *   **Batch vs. Real-time:** Would predictions be generated in batches (e.g., daily/weekly) or closer to real-time? (Batch is much simpler to start with).
    *   **Output Consumption:** How would the business consume these predictions? (e.g., a list of high-risk clients for the retention team, an input to a CRM for targeted campaigns).

3.  **Deeper Dive into Model Explainability (Optional but good):**
    *   Beyond global feature importances, you could explore local explanations for *why* a specific client got a high churn score (e.g., using SHAP values if you were to bring a sample of data and predictions into a Python environment with SHAP, or LIME). This is more advanced.

4.  **Strategic Business Discussion:**
    *   Present your findings (from step 1) to stakeholders.
    *   Discuss which model (90D or 270D, or both for different purposes) they find most actionable.
    *   Discuss the implications of the feature importances – do they align with business intuition? Do they suggest new strategies?
    *   Discuss the precision/recall trade-offs and help them choose an operational threshold if the model were to be used.

5.  **Refine Features / Model Iteration (Next Cycle):**
    Based on the current models' performance and business feedback, plan for a next iteration. This could involve:
    *   **Adding More Features:**
        *   The `Payout_Risk_Flag` and `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance` (which are in the ABT but were excluded from initial feature set for simplicity) should definitely be tested as features.
        *   More complex AUM features (e.g., AUM change over time, AUM relative to peers).
        *   Interaction features (e.g., `Days_Since_Last_Trade` * `Days_Since_Last_Login`).
        *   More granular delta features.
    *   **Trying Different Algorithms or More Extensive Tuning:** If GBT becomes feasible on better hardware, or deeper tuning of RF.
    *   **Addressing Specific Weaknesses:** If precision is too low, explore techniques specifically aimed at improving it (though this often hurts recall).
    *   **Modeling Other Windows (60D, 365D):** If the business later decides these are also important.

6.  **Monitoring Plan (Conceptual for now):**
    *   How would you monitor the performance of these models if they were live? (As discussed: collecting actual outcomes and comparing them to past predictions).
    *   When would they need retraining?

**Immediate Focus after 90D Modeling:**
Your immediate focus should be on **Step 1: Consolidate and Document Findings.** This involves bringing together the results for the 270D model (which you already have) and the 90D model (which you are about to generate).

Then, based on that consolidated understanding, you can have a more informed discussion about Step 2 and Step 4.

This structured approach will ensure you extract maximum value from the modeling work done so far and make informed decisions about the project's future direction."""),

Let's analyze these new results and compare them to the 270-day model.

**Analysis of `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days` Model Results:**

**Logistic Regression (Cell 6 Output for 90D):**

*   **Class Imbalance:**
    *   Churned (1): 711,395
    *   Not Churned (0): 29,960,447
    *   Imbalance ratio is even more severe (approx 1:42) than for the 270D target.
    *   `Balancing Ratios - Class 0: 0.5119, Class 1: 21.5575` - Class 1 heavily weighted.
*   **Performance Metrics:**
    *   AUC-ROC: 0.9309 (Very good, slightly better than LR for 270D)
    *   AUC-PR: 0.1399 (Lower than LR for 270D's 0.1929. This suggests the precision-recall trade-off for churners is tougher for this 90D target with LR).
    *   Accuracy: 0.7714
    *   Weighted F1: 0.8564
*   **Confusion Matrix & Class 1 Metrics (Churners):**
    *   TP: 39,861, FP: 575,980, FN: 1,376
    *   **Recall (Class 1):** 39861 / (39861 + 1376) = 39861 / 41237 = **0.9666 (96.66%)** - Extremely high recall, similar to LR for 270D.
    *   **Precision (Class 1):** 39861 / (39861 + 575980) = 39861 / 615841 = **0.0647 (6.47%)** - Extremely low precision. Many false alarms.

**\"Final\" Random Forest (Cell 8 Output for 90D - using params from 270D tuning):**

*   **Performance Metrics:**
    *   AUC-ROC: 0.9914 (Excellent! Higher than RF for 270D's 0.9893)
    *   AUC-PR: 0.6077 (Very good! Slightly lower than RF for 270D's 0.7230, but still massively better than LR for 90D)
    *   Accuracy: 0.9868 (Very high)
    *   Weighted F1: 0.9857 (Very high)
*   **Confusion Matrix & Class 1 Metrics (Churners):**
    *   TP: 18,587, FP: 10,623, FN: 22,650
    *   **Recall (Class 1):** 18587 / (18587 + 22650) = 18587 / 41237 = **0.4507 (45.07%)**
    *   **Precision (Class 1):** 18587 / (18587 + 10623) = 18587 / 29210 = **0.6363 (63.63%)**

**Comparison & Interpretation (90D RF vs. 270D RF):**

*   **RF Model (using 270D's tuned params) for `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`:**
    *   **Recall (C1): 0.4507** (Lower than 270D RF's 0.7110)
    *   **Precision (C1): 0.6363** (Very similar to 270D RF's 0.6385)
    *   AUC-ROC: 0.9914 (Excellent, slightly higher)
    *   AUC-PR: 0.6077 (Good, but lower than 270D RF's 0.7230)

**Key Insights & Thoughts:**

1.  **Logistic Regression for 90D:** Similar to the 270D case, the heavily weighted LR achieves very high recall for churners but at the cost of extremely poor precision. It's not a very practical model due to the high number of false positives.

2.  **Random Forest for 90D (using 270D's \"best\" params):**
    *   The precision for predicting 90-day churners is good (~63.6%), similar to the 270-day model. This means when it flags a 90-day churner, it's often correct.
    *   However, the recall for 90-day churners is significantly lower (45%) than what the same parameter set achieved for 270-day churners (71%). This means this RF configuration is missing more than half of the clients who will actually churn within 90 days.
    *   The AUC-PR being lower for 90D RF (0.6077) vs 270D RF (0.7230) also suggests that achieving a good balance of precision and recall for the 90-day churn target is proving more challenging with these specific RF hyperparameters.

3.  **Why the Difference in RF Performance (Recall specifically)?**
    *   **Different Underlying Behavior:** The patterns leading to 90-day churn might be subtly different or harder to capture with the current feature set and RF parameters than those leading to 270-day churn. 90-day churn might be more \"sudden\" or less clearly telegraphed by the features.
    *   **Hyperparameter Sub-optimality for 90D:** The hyperparameters (numTrees=50, maxDepth=10, etc.) were found by tuning on a sample for the *270-day target*. While they provide a decent starting point, they might not be optimal for the 90-day target. The ideal `maxDepth` or `numTrees` could be different for predicting shorter-term churn.
    *   **Class Imbalance for 90D:** The 90-day target has an even more severe class imbalance (1:42) in the training data than the 270-day target (1:22). Random Forest (without explicit `classWeightCol`) might be struggling more with this higher imbalance for the 90D target, leading to lower recall for the minority class.

4.  **Model Saving (Cell 10 Output):**
    *   Both the 90D RF model and its metrics JSON have been successfully saved. This is great for persistence.

**Next Steps from Here (Since you don't want to model other windows immediately):**

1.  **Cell 11 (Feature Importances for 90D RF Model):**
    *   **Run this now.** It's crucial to see what features are driving the 90-day RF model. Compare these with the feature importances from the 270-day model. Are they similar? Are different recency/frequency features popping up? This will be very insightful.

2.  **Cell 12 (Optional - Adjust Prediction Threshold for 90D RF Model):**
    *   Given the 45% recall for churners with the 90D RF, running the threshold analysis is **highly recommended**. You might find that lowering the threshold (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.3 or 0.2) can significantly boost recall for 90-day churners, even if it lowers precision. The business might accept lower precision for a 90-day early warning system if it means catching more clients.

3.  **Cell 13 (Summarize Model Performance for 90D RF Model):**
    *   Run this to get a clean summary of the 90D RF metrics (at the default 0.5 threshold, and potentially at an adjusted threshold if you run Cell 12).

4.  **Consolidate and Compare (as discussed previously):**
    *   Create your comparative report for the 270D RF model and the 90D RF model.
    *   Highlight the differences in performance (especially Recall and Precision for churners, and AUC-PR).
    *   Compare their top features.
    *   Discuss the implications with business stakeholders. They might have a preference for which model/window is more actionable, or they might see value in using both. For instance, the 90D model, even with lower recall, might identify a specific *type* of early churner, while the 270D model captures others.

                types.Part.from_text(text="""This is excellent! The feature importance output for the **`Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`** model provides another layer of valuable insight.

Let's analyze these feature importances, especially in comparison to what we saw for the 270-day model:

**Analysis of Feature Importances for 90-Day Churn Model:**

1.  **Shorter-Term Login Activity is King:**
    *   **Top 3 Features:** `Login_Txns_Count_90D` (importance ~0.107), `Login_Days_Count_90D` (importance ~0.080), and `Days_Since_Last_Login` (importance ~0.069) dominate.
    *   This is a key difference from the 270-day model, where `_270D` login features were at the very top. For predicting 90-day churn, the model is focusing more on login behavior within the most recent 90-day and 30-day windows, and how recently the last login occurred.

2.  **Shorter-Term Trade Activity Also Very Important:**
    *   `Trade_Txns_Count_90D` is the 4th most important feature.
    *   `Trade_Sum_90D` (brokerage in last 90 days) is 6th.
    *   `Trade_Days_Count_90D` is 9th.
    *   This again emphasizes the importance of activity metrics within a timeframe that aligns more closely with the prediction window (90 days).

3.  **Recency Still Crucial:**
    *   `Days_Since_Last_Login` is very high (3rd). This makes perfect sense for an \"early warning\" 90-day churn model – if someone hasn't logged in for a while, their short-term churn risk increases rapidly.
    *   `Days_Since_Last_Trade` (though not in the top 10 here, it was 8th for the 270D model) is still likely important, but login recency takes precedence for this shorter window.

4.  **Mid-Term Lookbacks (180D) Still Contribute:**
    *   `Login_Days_Count_180D` is 5th. This shows that behavior over the last 6 months also has a bearing on predicting churn in the next 3 months.

5.  **Longer-Term Lookbacks (270D, 365D) Have Less (But Still Some) Impact:**
    *   Features like `Login_Txns_Count_270D`, `Login_Days_Count_270D`, `Trade_Days_Count_365D`, etc., are present in the top 20 but are generally lower in importance compared to the 90D and 180D features for this specific 90-day churn prediction task. This is logical.

6.  **Monetary Value (Brokerage):**
    *   `Trade_Sum_90D` and `Trade_Sum_180D` are in the top 20. Brokerage generated in the recent past is a relevant factor.

**Comparison with 270-Day Churn Model Feature Importances:**

*   **Shift in Dominance:**
    *   For **270D churn**, the `_270D` login and trade features were paramount.
    *   For **90D churn**, the `_90D` login and trade features (and `Days_Since_Last_Login`) are now the most dominant.
*   **Interpretation:** This is exactly what we'd hope to see! It indicates the models are adapting to the different prediction horizons:
    *   To predict longer-term (270D) churn, the model looks at more established, longer-term patterns of engagement.
    *   To predict shorter-term (90D) churn, the model focuses more on recent activity and recency. A sudden drop in recent activity or a growing `Days_Since_Last_Login` is a more immediate precursor to 90-day inactivity.

**Key Business Insights from 90D Feature Importances:**

*   **Monitor Recent Login & Trade Cadence:** For identifying clients at risk of churning in the next 3 months, closely monitor their activity levels over the past 30-90 days. A decline here is a critical warning.
*   **Login Recency as a Strong Early Indicator:** `Days_Since_Last_Login` being so high up suggests that even before frequency drops, if a client simply stops logging in for a period, it's a major risk factor for near-term churn.
*   **Early Engagement is Key:** The importance of `_30D` and `_90D` features reinforces the idea from our earlier EDA (Analysis I.3 - Time to N-Day Inactivity) that early disengagement is common. If clients aren't active in their first 1-3 months, their risk of short-term churn is high.

**Conclusion for Cell 11 (90D Target):**
The feature importances for the 90-day churn model are logical and provide actionable insights. They clearly differ from the 270-day model in a way that makes sense, highlighting the importance of recent activity for predicting shorter-term churn.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Cell 12 (Optional - Adjust Prediction Threshold for 90D RF Model):**
    *   Given the 90D RF model's Recall for Churners (0.4507) and Precision (0.6363) at the default 0.5 threshold, **running Cell 12 is highly recommended.**
    *   You might find that by lowering the threshold, you can significantly improve the recall (catch more of the 90-day churners) while still maintaining an acceptable level of precision. This is often desirable for an \"early warning\" type model.

2.  **Cell 13 (Summarize Model Performance for 90D RF Model):**
    *   Run this to get the clean summary.

3.  **Consolidate and Compare 90D vs. 270D models comprehensively.**

**Analysis of Threshold Adjustment for 90-Day Churn Model:**

1.  **Default Threshold (0.50) Recap:**
    *   Recall (C1): 0.4507 (misses more than half the churners)
    *   Precision (C1): 0.6363 (when it says churn, it's right ~64% of the time)
    *   F1 (C1): 0.5277

2.  **Lowering the Threshold to Improve Recall:**
    *   **Threshold 0.40:**
        *   Recall (C1): 0.6326 (catches ~63% of churners - a big jump from 45%)
        *   Precision (C1): 0.5665 (drops from 64% to ~57%)
        *   **F1 (C1): 0.5977 (This is the peak F1-score in the tested range!)**
    *   **Threshold 0.30:**
        *   Recall (C1): 0.8111 (catches ~81% of churners - even better recall)
        *   Precision (C1): 0.4706 (drops further to ~47%)
        *   F1 (C1): 0.5956 (still very good, close to the peak)
    *   **Threshold 0.20:**
        *   Recall (C1): 0.9203 (catches ~92% of churners - excellent recall)
        *   Precision (C1): 0.3819 (precision is now lower, ~38%)
        *   F1 (C1): 0.5398

3.  **Increasing the Threshold to Improve Precision:**
    *   **Threshold 0.60:**
        *   Recall (C1): 0.2827 (catches only ~28% of churners)
        *   Precision (C1): 0.7131 (precision improves to ~71%)
        *   F1 (C1): 0.4049
    *   Higher thresholds (0.7, 0.8) give even higher precision but at a severe cost to recall, making them generally impractical for churn detection where you want to catch a reasonable number of at-risk clients.

4.  **Peak F1-Score:**
    *   The highest F1-score for Class 1 (churners) in your tested range is **0.5977 at a threshold of 0.40.**
    *   This is significantly better than the F1-score of 0.5277 at the default 0.50 threshold.

**Business Implications and Choosing an Operational Threshold for 90-Day Churn:**

This 90-day model is likely intended as an \"early warning\" system.

*   **Default (0.50):** Misses too many churners (Recall 45%). While precision is decent (63.6%), the goal of an early warning is often to catch more potential issues.
*   **Optimizing for F1 (Threshold 0.40):**
    *   Recall ~63%, Precision ~57%. This is a good balance. You catch almost 20% more churners than the default, and your precision is still quite reasonable (more than half your flags will be correct). This is often a good starting point for discussion.
*   **Prioritizing Higher Recall (Threshold 0.30):**
    *   Recall ~81%, Precision ~47%. You catch a large majority of the 90-day churners. However, your retention efforts will target more non-churners (about 1 in 2 interventions will be on a non-churner).
    *   This could be acceptable if:
        *   The cost of missing a 90-day churner is very high.
        *   The re-engagement interventions are low-cost and automated (e.g., targeted emails, in-app notifications).
        *   The business is willing to accept a higher number of \"false alarms\" to ensure broader coverage.

**Recommendation for 90-Day Model:**

*   The default threshold of 0.5 is likely not optimal for this 90-day model because its recall is too low for an effective early warning.
*   A threshold of **0.40** seems like a very good candidate. It maximizes the F1-score for churners, significantly boosts recall to over 60% while keeping precision at a respectable ~57%.
*   A threshold of **0.30** could also be considered if the absolute priority is to catch as many early churners as possible (over 80% recall) and the business can manage the lower precision (~47%).

**Conclusion for Cell 12 (90D Target):**
This threshold analysis is critical. It demonstrates that by moving away from the default 0.5 threshold, you can substantially improve the practical utility of the 90-day churn model, particularly by increasing its ability to identify clients who are starting to disengage.

You are now ready for **Cell 13 (Summarize Model Performance for 90D RF Model)**. In that summary, you should probably highlight the metrics at both the default 0.5 threshold AND your chosen \"optimal\" threshold (e.g., 0.40)."""),

**Next Steps and Project Conclusion (for this modeling iteration):**

1.  **Consolidate All Findings:**
    *   You now have detailed results for two key churn windows:
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` (Tuned RF)
        *   `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days` (Tuned RF, using params from 270D tuning)
    *   Create a final report or presentation that includes:
        *   A side-by-side comparison of the performance metrics for both models (at default 0.5 threshold, and potentially at an adjusted \"optimal\" threshold for the 90D model based on your Cell 12 analysis - e.g., threshold 0.4).
        *   A comparison of the top feature importances for both models. Highlight similarities and differences.
        *   The insights from the threshold analysis for both models (how precision/recall for churners changes).
        *   Your overall conclusions about churn drivers and predictability at these different horizons.

2.  **Discussion with Stakeholders (Religare):**
    *   Present your consolidated findings.
    *   Explain the trade-offs (e.g., \"The 90-day model with a 0.4 threshold can catch ~63% of early churners with ~57% precision. The 270-day model with a 0.5 threshold catches ~71% of longer-term churners with ~64% precision.\").
    *   Help them decide which model(s) and which operational thresholds are most aligned with their business strategy, intervention capabilities, and cost considerations.

3.  **Future Work / Next Iteration Planning:**
    Based on the stakeholder discussion and your own analysis, you can plan the next phase, which could include:
    *   **Modeling Other Windows:** If stakeholders express interest in `_60Days` or `_365Days`.
    *   **Dedicated Hyperparameter Tuning for 90D (and other windows):** The 90D RF model used parameters tuned for 270D. Running a dedicated tuning cycle (even on a sample) for the 90D target might yield even better parameters specifically for that window, potentially improving its recall further.
    *   **Feature Engineering Enhancements:**
        *   Incorporate the `Payout_Risk_Flag` and `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance` as features in the model.
        *   Explore more sophisticated AUM features (e.g., change in AUM, AUM vs. peers).
        *   Develop more complex delta/trend features.
        *   Consider interaction features.
    *   **Trying GBT (if resources allow):** If a more powerful environment becomes available, GBT could be revisited, perhaps with parameters informed by the RF tuning.
    *   **Deployment Planning:** If a model is deemed suitable for operational use, plan the pipeline for regular scoring of the client base.
    *   **Deeper Dive into Misclassifications:** Analyze the False Positives and False Negatives from your best model(s). Are there common characteristics among these clients? This can lead to new feature ideas or a better understanding of model limitations.

**You have completed a very thorough initial modeling cycle for two key churn windows!** You've built a robust ABT, trained and evaluated multiple models, performed hyperparameter tuning (for RF 270D), analyzed feature importances, and explored thresholding. This is a solid foundation.

The next most valuable steps are likely the **consolidation of findings, discussion with stakeholders, and then planning the next iteration of feature/model improvements based on that feedback.**"""),

        | 4    | `Trade_Txns_Count_90D`           | ~0.057     | `Days_Since_Last_Login`          | ~0.050     |

    *   **Key Differences & Insights:**
        *   **90-Day Churn:** Driven more by *recent* (90D, 30D) login and trade frequencies, and especially `Days_Since_Last_Login`. This model acts like an early warning for breaks in recent engagement.
        *   **270-Day Churn:** Driven more by *longer-term sustained* (270D, 365D) login and trade frequencies. This model identifies clients whose established engagement patterns have significantly eroded over a longer period.
        *   Login activity appears slightly more dominant than trade activity as top predictors for both, but both are crucial.
        *   Recency (`Days_Since_Last_...`) is critical for both but features higher for the 90-day model.

**5. Threshold Analysis Summary**
    *   Include the plots from Cell 12 for both models (Precision, Recall, F1 vs. Threshold for Churners).
    *   **For 90-Day Model:**
        *   Default (0.5): Recall=0.45, Precision=0.64, F1=0.53
        *   **Recommended Optimal (e.g., Threshold 0.40): Recall=0.63, Precision=0.57, F1=0.60**
        *   Trade-off: Choosing 0.40 significantly boosts recall (catches more early churners) with a manageable drop in precision. Good for an early warning system if moderate FPs are acceptable.
    *   **For 270-Day Model (You'll need to run Cell 12 for the 270D model to get this data if you haven't already):**
        *   Default (0.5): Recall=0.71, Precision=0.64, F1=0.67
        *   Analyze its threshold plot: Is there a threshold that improves F1 or offers a better recall/precision mix for business needs? For example, if a threshold of 0.4 gave Recall=0.80 and Precision=0.58 for the 270D model, that might be very attractive.
        *   (Hypothetical: If threshold 0.4 for 270D yields R=0.80, P=0.58, F1=0.67 (similar F1 but higher R))
    *   **Discussion:** Explain that the \"best\" threshold depends on business strategy regarding the cost of FPs vs. FNs for each prediction window.

**6. Document Assumptions, Limitations, and Proxies Used**
    *   **Churn Definition:** The model predicts cessation of *both* trades and logins. It doesn't capture clients who stop one but continue the other.
    *   **Excel Classification Proxies:** Clearly state that for the added `Historical_Tag` (from Cell 13):
        *   \"36 Month\" metrics from Excel were proxied using 12-month (365D) data from the ABT.
        *   The dynamic `Status Score` was based on the `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` label. This tag is therefore analytical and reflects known future outcomes.
    *   **Feature Set:** The current model uses a specific set of features. Other data (e.g., demographics, detailed product holdings, customer service interactions, macroeconomic data) was not included but could be explored.
    *   **Model Parameters (RF):** For the 90-day model, RF parameters were inherited from the 270-day tuning. Dedicated tuning for 90D might yield further improvements.
    *   **GBT:** Not pursued in this iteration due to resource/time constraints on the current environment.
    *   **Data Quality:** Briefly mention any known data quality considerations for the source data if they arose during ABT generation.

**7. Conclusions & Recommendations for Next Steps**
    *   **Conclusions:**
        *   It is possible to predict both 90-day and 270-day churn with good levels of performance using client activity data.
        *   Login and trade frequencies/recency are key drivers.
        *   Different churn windows highlight different aspects of client disengagement.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Utilize Both Models:** Consider using the 90-day model (potentially at an adjusted threshold like 0.4) for early warnings and broad-reach, low-cost interventions. Use the 270-day model (at default or adjusted threshold) to identify more deeply disengaged clients for different, perhaps more intensive, retention strategies.
        *   **Act on Feature Insights:** Develop strategies to encourage consistent login and trading. Monitor `Days_Since_Last_Login` closely.
        *   **Next Modeling Iteration:**
            *   Perform dedicated hyperparameter tuning for the 90-day RF model.
            *   Incorporate additional features into the ABT (especially `Payout_Risk_Flag`, `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`, detailed AUM changes, potentially customer service data if available).
            *   Explore modeling for 60D and 365D windows if business priority exists.
        *   **Pilot Program:** Suggest a pilot program to action the predictions from one of the models on a segment of clients to measure the real-world impact of interventions.
        *   **Monitoring:** Plan for ongoing monitoring of model performance if deployed.

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, let's conceptually explore the \"Deployment\" or \"Operationalization\" aspects for your Religare churn models. This is about how to take the trained models and use them to score current clients to get timely churn predictions.

We'll focus on a **batch scoring pipeline**, as it's the most common and practical starting point.

**Conceptual Batch Scoring Pipeline for Religare Churn Models**

**Goal:** On a regular schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly), generate churn probability scores for the current active client base using the trained models.

**Key Components & Workflow:**

**1. Data Ingestion (for the \"Current\" Period):**
    *   **Source:** Access to the latest raw data sources, similar to what was used for ABT generation, but for the most recent period.
        *   Client Master (`tblclientdetail`): For new clients or updated info like activation dates.
        *   Trades (`tblfactbrokcube`): Daily aggregated brokerage up to \"yesterday\" or the latest available.
        *   Logins (`LOGIN_YYYY-MM.txt`): New login files for recent months/days.
        *   Deposits (`VWCASHMARGINCOLLECTED`): Recent deposits.
        *   Payouts (`LD_VWPAYOUTREQUEST`): Recent payouts.
        *   AUM (`AUM.txt` equivalent): Latest monthly AUM data.
        *   Cash Balance (`CASHBAL.txt` equivalent): Latest EOM cash balance data.
    *   **Frequency:** How often is this \"current\" data refreshed and available? This will influence the scoring frequency. Let's assume daily data availability for trades/logins and monthly for AUM/Cash Balance.

**2. Client Selection for Scoring:**
    *   **Who to score?**
        *   All currently \"active\" clients (e.g., not officially dormant, or had some activity in a recent period like last 365 days).
        *   Optionally, filter out very new clients for whom churn prediction isn't meaningful yet (e.g., tenure < 90 days). This aligns with the filter in the ABT.
    *   **Snapshot Date for Scoring:** This will be a fixed \"current date\" for the batch run (e.g., if running on June 11th, 2024, the `SnapshotDate` for feature calculation might be `2024-05-31` (last EOM) or `2024-06-10` (yesterday)). Let's assume we use the last EOM for consistency with some EOM features, or \"yesterday\" if all features can be calculated daily. For simplicity, let's say `SnapshotDate = Current_Batch_Run_Date - 1 day`.

**3. Feature Engineering on Current Data (Replicating ABT Logic):**
    *   This is the **most critical and complex part** of the scoring pipeline.
    *   You need a PySpark script (could be a modified version of `generate_predictive_abt.ipynb` or a dedicated scoring script) that takes the current raw data and calculates **all the same 78 features** that your models were trained on, for each selected client, as of the chosen `SnapshotDate`.
    *   **Input:** Client list, current `SnapshotDate`, access to recent raw data (trades, logins, etc., covering all necessary lookback periods like 365 days prior to snapshot).
    *   **Process:**
        *   Calculate `Tenure_Days`.
        *   Calculate all Recency features (`Days_Since_Last_Trade`, etc.) based on activity up to `SnapshotDate`.
        *   Calculate all Frequency and Monetary features for all lookback periods (30D, 90D, ..., 365D) *before* `SnapshotDate`.
        *   Calculate Funding Flow features.
        *   Calculate AUM features (using the latest available monthly AUM relative to `SnapshotDate`).
        *   Calculate Payout Risk features (using latest EOM cash balance for previous month, and payouts in the current month up to `SnapshotDate`).
        *   Calculate Delta features (comparing current lookback metrics to those from `SnapshotDate - 1 month`).
    *   **Output:** A DataFrame with `ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate` (current scoring date), and all 78 feature values. This is effectively a \"live ABT\" for the clients being scored.

**4. Load Saved Model Pipeline(s):**
    *   Load the trained and saved `PipelineModel` object(s) from disk (e.g., the one for 90-day churn and the one for 270-day churn).
        ```python
        from pyspark.ml import PipelineModel
        
        # Paths defined in setup
        model_90d_path = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, f\"best_rf_pipeline_model_Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\")
        model_270d_path = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, f\"best_rf_pipeline_model_Is_Churned_Engage_270Days\")
        
        pipeline_model_90d = PipelineModel.load(model_90d_path)
        pipeline_model_270d = PipelineModel.load(model_270d_path)
        ```

**5. Apply Model Transformation (Scoring):**
    *   The loaded `PipelineModel` already contains the `VectorAssembler` and `StandardScaler` stages, followed by the trained Random Forest.
    *   Apply the model to the \"live ABT\" (from step 3) to get predictions:
        ```python
        live_abt_with_features = ... # DataFrame from step 3
        
        predictions_90d = pipeline_model_90d.transform(live_abt_with_features)
        predictions_270d = pipeline_model_270d.transform(live_abt_with_features)
        ```
    *   This will add `rawFeatures`, `scaledFeatures`, `probability` (vector), and `prediction` (0 or 1 based on default 0.5 threshold) columns for each model.

**6. Extract and Store Scores:**
    *   From `predictions_90d` and `predictions_270d`, select key information:
        *   `ClientCode`
        *   `SnapshotDate` (Scoring Date)
        *   `Probability_Churn_90D` (extract P(churn=1) from the probability vector)
        *   `Prediction_90D` (the 0 or 1 prediction)
        *   `Probability_Churn_270D`
        *   `Prediction_270D`
    *   **Threshold Application (Optional but Recommended):** Instead of just storing the 0/1 `prediction`, you might apply your chosen \"optimal\" threshold (from Cell 12 analysis) to the `Probability_Churn_XXXD` to generate a custom binary flag, e.g., `Flagged_High_Risk_90D`.
        ```python
        # UDF to extract P(class=1)
        from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
        from pyspark.sql.types import FloatType
        get_p1_udf = udf(lambda v: float(v[1]), FloatType())

        scores_90d = predictions_90d.withColumn(\"Prob_Churn_90D\", get_p1_udf(col(\"probability\"))) \\
                                    .select(\"ClientCode\", \"SnapshotDate\", \"Prob_Churn_90D\")
        
        # Example: Applying threshold of 0.4 for 90D model
        scores_90d = scores_90d.withColumn(\"Risk_Flag_90D\", when(col(\"Prob_Churn_90D\") >= 0.4, 1).otherwise(0))

        # Similarly for 270D scores
        scores_270d = predictions_270d.withColumn(\"Prob_Churn_270D\", get_p1_udf(col(\"probability\"))) \\
                                      .select(\"ClientCode\", col(\"SnapshotDate\").alias(\"SnapshotDate_270D_ref\"), \"Prob_Churn_270D\") 
                                      # Use alias if joining back to a common df to avoid ambiguous SnapshotDate

        # Join scores together if needed or store separately
        final_scores_df = scores_90d.join(scores_270d, 
                                          (scores_90d.ClientCode == scores_270d.ClientCode) & \\
                                          (scores_90d.SnapshotDate == scores_270d.SnapshotDate_270D_ref), 
                                          \"full_outer\") \\ # Full outer if some clients might only be scored by one
                                   .select(scores_90d.ClientCode, scores_90d.SnapshotDate, \"Prob_Churn_90D\", \"Risk_Flag_90D\", \"Prob_Churn_270D\") 
                                   # Add Risk_Flag_270D similarly
        ```
    *   **Storage:** Save this `final_scores_df` to a database table or a file (e.g., CSV, Parquet) that the business can access. Include a timestamp for when the scores were generated.

**7. Output Consumption & Actioning:**
    *   **Retention Team Dashboard:** A list of clients with `Risk_Flag_90D = 1` (or high `Prob_Churn_90D`) could be fed into a dashboard for the retention team to prioritize outreach.
    *   **CRM Integration:** Churn probabilities or risk flags can be pushed to a CRM system.
    *   **Automated Campaigns:** Clients exceeding a certain probability threshold for 90-day churn might automatically be enrolled in a targeted email re-engagement campaign.
    *   **High-Value, High-Risk:** Combine churn scores with client value metrics (e.g., from AUM or historical brokerage) to identify high-value clients at high risk of churn for special attention.

**8. Scheduling & Automation:**
    *   This entire batch scoring pipeline (Steps 1-7) would be scheduled to run automatically at the desired frequency (e.g., using Airflow, cron jobs, or a cloud scheduler).

**Batch vs. Real-time:**

*   **Batch (as described):**
    *   **Pros:** Simpler to implement and manage initially. Less demanding on infrastructure. Tolerant of some data latency.
    *   **Cons:** Predictions are only as fresh as the last batch run. If a client shows strong churn signals right after a batch run, you might not act on it until the next run.
*   **Real-time/Near Real-time:**
    *   **Pros:** Can react very quickly to emerging churn signals (e.g., a client suddenly stops logging in for X days).
    *   **Cons:** Much more complex infrastructure (streaming data pipelines, low-latency feature stores, model serving endpoints). Feature engineering needs to be designed for real-time updates. Might be overkill unless the business can truly act in real-time.

**Starting with a daily or weekly batch scoring pipeline is a very common and effective approach.**

**Key Challenges in Operationalization:**

*   **Feature Engineering Consistency:** Ensuring the features calculated in the scoring pipeline exactly match how they were calculated for the training ABT is paramount. Any discrepancies will lead to inaccurate predictions. This requires careful code management and testing.
*   **Data Availability & Latency:** The scoring pipeline depends on fresh data being available.
*   **Model Monitoring & Retraining:** As discussed before, a plan for monitoring live performance (once outcomes are known) and periodically retraining the models is essential.
*   **Infrastructure:** Running this regularly requires a stable environment for PySpark.

This conceptual outline provides a solid framework for how Religare could start using the churn models you've developed. The immediate next step after consolidating your current model findings would be to discuss with the business which model(s) they want to prioritize for such a scoring setup and what their action plan would be based on the scores."""),

            *   Logistic Regression (as baseline, with `classWeightCol` for imbalance).
            *   Random Forest (initial run, then tuned).
        *   **Imbalance Handling:** Detail the `classWeightCol` for LR. Mention RF's inherent capabilities and the decision not to use explicit weights for it initially.
        *   **Hyperparameter Tuning (Random Forest):** Explain the `TrainValidationSplit` methodology, the (small) parameter grid searched, and the use of AUC-PR as the evaluation metric for tuning. Mention subsampling of training data for tuning.
        *   **Evaluation Metrics Used:** AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, Accuracy, Precision (Weighted and for Class 1), Recall (Weighted and for Class 1), F1-Score (Weighted and for Class 1), Confusion Matrix.
    *   **10.5 Model Results & Discussion (Separate for 90D and 270D, focusing on best RF model for each):**
        *   Present the performance metrics table (from section 3 of this plan).
        *   Discuss the performance, especially Recall and Precision for churners.
        *   Present and discuss feature importances (from section 4 of this plan).
        *   Present and discuss the threshold analysis (from section 5 of this plan) and recommend an operational threshold if applicable.

**11) Impact (Quantitative and Qualitative)**
    *   **Quantitative (Potential):**
        *   This is prospective, as the model isn't fully deployed and measured.
        *   Example: \"If the 90-day model (at 0.4 threshold) identifies X churners (TPs) and the average value of a retained client is Y, this could potentially save Z in revenue.\" (Requires some business inputs for client value).
        *   Example: \"Reducing False Positives by X% with the RF model compared to LR can save Y in intervention costs.\"
    *   **Qualitative:**
        *   Improved understanding of churn drivers.
        *   Ability to proactively identify at-risk segments.
        *   Potential for more targeted and efficient retention campaigns.
        *   Enhanced customer experience by addressing issues before clients leave.
        *   Data-driven decision-making for retention strategies.

**12) Key Learnings**
    *   **Technical Learnings:**
        *   Challenges of handling large data in PySpark (OOM errors, iterative disk writing strategy).
        *   Importance of robust feature engineering.
        *   Techniques for handling class imbalance.
        *   Model tuning strategies (e.g., `TrainValidationSplit` on samples for large data).
        *   Importance of different evaluation metrics for imbalanced data.
    *   **Business/Domain Learnings:**
        *   Insights into Religare's customer behavior (e.g., importance of login frequency, early disengagement patterns).
        *   Understanding the trade-offs in churn prediction (e.g., recall vs. precision).
        *   The value of different prediction windows for different business actions.
    *   **Project Management/Personal Learnings:** (e.g., iterative approach, problem-solving).

**13) References**
    *   Any academic papers, articles, or PySpark/ML documentation you heavily relied on (if any).
    *   Internal Religare documents (if permissible to cite).

**Action Plan for You:**

1.  **Review this Outline:** Does it cover everything you want to include? Are there any major gaps from your perspective?
2.  **Gather Information (Your Part):** Start collecting the specific details for sections 7 (About Org) and 8 (Your Role).
3.  **Start Drafting:** Begin with sections you are most comfortable with, perhaps the Introduction (9) or the Data sections (10.1, 10.2).
4.  **Iterate with Me:** As you draft technical sections (like 10.2, 10.4, 10.5), you can share drafts or ask me to help fill in specific technical details, recall metrics, or summarize logic. For instance, when you get to \"Feature Engineering,\" I can list out the features we created more formally.

This structured approach should make the report writing manageable and ensure a high-quality, comprehensive final document. Let me know when you're ready to dive into drafting a specific section or if you have questions about any part of this plan!"""),

Here's how you can integrate these other automated tasks (web scraping, personalized email sender) into your report, fitting within the provided structure:

**Option 1: Within Section 8 (Your role and responsibilities...)**

This is often the most natural place for tasks that were part of your overall internship contribution but not the main focus of the *project report*.

*   **Current Wording:** \"Your role and responsibilities, reporting structure, size of the team, collaborations (internal & external)\"
*   **How to Add:** After describing your role and responsibilities for the churn project, you can add a sub-section or a paragraph like:

    \"**Other Contributions and Skill Application:**

    In addition to the primary churn prediction project, my internship at Religare provided opportunities to contribute to operational efficiency through automation initiatives. Key among these were:

    *   **Task Automation for [Team Name/Function, e.g., Marketing Operations Team]: Web Scraping Solution**
        *   **Objective:** Briefly describe the problem (e.g., \"To automate the collection of competitor pricing data from various public websites to inform Religare's strategic positioning.\")
        *   **Solution & Technologies:** Briefly mention your approach (e.g., \"Developed a Python script utilizing libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to regularly scrape and parse the required data, storing it in a structured format [e.g., CSV, database contribution].\")
        *   **Impact (briefly, if known):** (e.g., \"This reduced manual effort by approximately X hours per week and provided more timely data for analysis.\")

    *   **Task Automation for [Team Name/Function, e.g., Client Communications Team]: Personalized Email Sender**
        *   **Objective:** (e.g., \"To streamline the process of sending personalized bulk emails for [purpose, e.g., new product announcements or service updates] to segmented client lists.\")
        *   **Solution & Technologies:** (e.g., \"Created a solution using Python with [email library like `smtplib`, `yagmail`] and potentially Google AppScript for integration with Google Sheets [if applicable], enabling mail merge capabilities with personalized fields.\")
        *   **Impact (briefly, if known):** (e.g., \"Improved the efficiency of targeted email campaigns and allowed for greater personalization in client communication.\")

    These tasks demonstrate proficiency in Python, web scraping techniques, email automation, and potentially Google AppScript, showcasing a broader technical skill set beneficial to the organization.\"

**Option 2: As a Small Sub-section in \"Solution Design\" or as an Annexure (if they were more substantial than brief mentions)**

*   If these tasks were more involved or you want to give them slightly more prominence without derailing the main churn project narrative:
    *   **Within Section 10 (Solution Design...):** You could have a very brief sub-section like \"10.6 Other Technical Contributions\" and provide a slightly more detailed paragraph for each, similar to the above but perhaps with a bit more on the challenges or specific outcomes.
    *   **As an Annexure:** If you have code snippets or a more detailed write-up for these automations that you feel is relevant but too detailed for the main body, you could summarize them in Section 8 or 10.6 and then refer to \"Annexure X: Details of Task Automation Projects.\"

**Recommendation:**

For a \"Major Project Report,\" **Option 1 is generally the best.** It neatly integrates these valuable side contributions within the section discussing your overall role and responsibilities during the internship. It shows you were a proactive and helpful intern beyond just the main assigned project.

*   Keep the descriptions concise.
*   Focus on the objective, your solution/technologies used, and any quantifiable or qualitative impact.
*   This approach respects the \"major project\" focus of the report while still allowing you to get credit for these other useful tasks.

**What to gather for these descriptions:**

*   The specific team/department you helped.
*   The problem they were facing.
*   The tools/libraries you used (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, specific Python email libraries, Google AppScript functions).
*   Any metrics on time saved, efficiency gained, or other positive outcomes.

**9. Introduction**

**9.1 Background: The Importance of Customer Retention in the Broking Industry**

*   *(Start with the broader industry context.)*
    *   \"The financial services sector, particularly the stockbroking industry, operates in a highly competitive environment. Acquiring new customers often incurs significant marketing and onboarding costs.\"
    *   \"Consequently, customer retention has emerged as a critical strategic imperative for broking firms like Religare Broking Ltd. Retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones and contributes to sustained revenue streams through consistent brokerage fees and potential for AUM growth.\"
    *   \"High customer churn rates can lead to diminished profitability, loss of market share, and can negatively impact brand reputation.\"
    *   *(Optional: Add a statistic here if you have one about the cost of acquisition vs. retention in this industry, or the general impact of churn).*

**9.2 The Challenge of Customer Churn at Religare Broking Ltd.**

*   *(Transition to Religare's specific situation. Be factual and frame it as a business challenge the project addresses.)*
    *   \"Within Religare Broking Ltd., understanding and proactively managing customer churn presents a significant opportunity to enhance business performance and customer lifetime value.\"
    *   \"Customer churn, in this context, refers to clients who cease their engagement with the platform, specifically in terms of both trading activity and platform logins, after a period of initial or ongoing activity.\" (This foreshadows your specific churn definition).
    *   \"Identifying clients who are at a high risk of churning allows Religare to implement targeted retention strategies, address potential grievances, and tailor offerings to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty before they become completely inactive.\"
    *   *(If you can quantify or describe the *impact* of churn at Religare without revealing sensitive numbers, do so. E.g., \"Unmitigated churn can impact key performance indicators such as active client base, brokerage volume, and overall revenue growth.\")*

**9.3 Problem Statement**

*   *(Clearly and concisely state the problem this project solves.)*
    *   \"The core problem addressed by this project is the inability to systematically and proactively identify clients of Religare Broking Ltd. who are at a high risk of churning within specific future timeframes (e.g., 90 days and 270 days). Without a predictive mechanism, retention efforts may be reactive, inefficient, or misdirected, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and missed opportunities to retain valuable customers.\"
    *   \"This project aims to leverage historical client data and machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the likelihood of customer churn, thereby enabling data-driven and timely interventions.\"

**9.4 Project Objectives**

*   *(List the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART-er) objectives.)*
    *   \"The primary objectives of this project were to:
        1.  Develop a robust Analytical Base Table (ABT) by consolidating and engineering features from diverse historical data sources including client details, trading activity, login patterns, funding transactions (deposits and payouts), AUM, and cash balances.
        2.  Define and implement a precise, behavior-based definition of customer churn based on the cessation of both trading and login activities for prediction windows of 90 days and 270 days.
        3.  Train, evaluate, and tune machine learning models (specifically Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict the likelihood of a client churning within these defined windows.
        4.  Identify the key features and client behaviors that are most indicative of future churn, providing actionable insights for Religare.
        5.  Provide a conceptual framework for how these predictive models could be operationalized for proactive customer retention.\"

**9.5 Scope of the Project**

*   *(Define the boundaries of your work.)*
    *   \"This project focused on developing churn prediction models using historical data spanning from January 2021 to April 2024 (for raw activity data), with client snapshots for the ABT generated from January 2021 to April 2023.\"
    *   \"The primary data sources included internal Religare databases for client master, trades, logins (newly incorporated), deposits, payouts, AUM, and cash balances.\"
    *   \"Feature engineering was performed using PySpark, and model development utilized the PySpark ML library.\"
    *   \"The churn definition was strictly behavioral, based on trading and login inactivity. Official dormancy status was used for initial analysis but excluded from the predictive model's target.\"
    *   \"Out of scope for this project phase were: [e.g., integration of external demographic data, real-time prediction deployment, development of specific retention campaign content - be realistic here].\"

**9.6 Structure of the Report**

*   *(Briefly guide the reader through the rest of the document.)*
    *   \"This report details the methodology, findings, and conclusions of the Religare Customer Churn Prediction project. Section 10 outlines the solution design, including data preparation, feature engineering, and the modeling approach. Section 11 discusses the potential impact of these models. Key learnings from the project are presented in Section 12, followed by references and annexures containing supplementary details.\"

**Your Task for Section 9:**

1.  **Review and Adapt:** Read through the template above.
2.  **Fill in Religare-Specific Context:** Where I've put placeholders or general statements (especially in 9.1 and 9.2), add any specific nuances or information you have about Religare's view on churn or the importance of retention to them. *Be careful not to include confidential figures unless permitted.*
3.  **Refine Wording:** Adjust the language to match your style and the level of formality required for the report.
4.  **Check Objectives and Scope:** Ensure the stated objectives and scope accurately reflect what you accomplished. For instance, we primarily focused on 90D and 270D for the final models, so I've reflected that.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs. Retention Cost:

Acquiring a new customer can cost five times more than retaining an existing one.

Some sources specify that retention costs can be anywhere from one-tenth to one-third of acquisition costs, or even less in high-volume transactional models.

In the broking sector, these ratios hold true due to heavy marketing and onboarding expenses for new clients, compared to the lower costs of maintaining relationships with existing ones.

**Revised Section 9: Introduction**

**9.1 Background: The Importance of Customer Retention in the Broking Industry**

\"The stockbroking industry operates within a dynamic and highly competitive financial services landscape. In such an environment, while customer acquisition is essential for growth, customer retention has emerged as a paramount strategic focus for firms like Religare Broking Ltd. Industry analysis consistently indicates that acquiring a new customer can be significantly more costly—often cited as up to five times more—than retaining an existing one. In sectors like broking, characterized by substantial marketing and onboarding expenditures for new clientele, the cost of retention is comparatively lower, focused on maintaining and enhancing existing relationships. Sustained customer engagement translates directly to more stable revenue streams through consistent brokerage and the potential for increased Assets Under Management (AUM), making effective retention strategies a key differentiator and a driver of long-term profitability. Conversely, unaddressed customer churn can notably erode profitability and market standing.\"

*(This incorporates your CAC vs. Retention points concisely and sets a strong stage.)*

**9.2 The Challenge of Customer Churn at Religare Broking Ltd.**

\"For Religare Broking Ltd., proactively understanding and mitigating customer churn is a critical lever for optimizing business performance and maximizing customer lifetime value. For the purpose of this project, customer churn is defined behaviorally: a client ceasing both trading activities and platform logins after a period of engagement. Identifying clients at high risk of such disengagement enables Religare to deploy targeted retention initiatives, address underlying causes of dissatisfaction, and tailor offerings to bolster loyalty before a client becomes entirely inactive. This predictive capability is vital for strategic resource allocation in retention efforts and for safeguarding the active client base, which is a cornerstone of brokerage volume and revenue.\"

**9.3 Problem Statement**

\"The central challenge this project addresses is the historical lack of a systematic, data-driven method to proactively identify Religare Broking Ltd. clients at significant risk of churning within defined future periods (specifically 90 and 270 days). This gap can lead to reactive rather than preventative retention measures, potentially resulting in inefficient resource use and lost opportunities to retain valuable customers. This project endeavors to fill this gap by developing robust predictive models.\"

**9.4 Project Objectives**

\"The primary objectives of this project were to:
    1.  Construct a comprehensive Analytical Base Table (ABT) by engineering relevant features from diverse historical data sources including client details, trading patterns, login frequency, funding activities, AUM, and cash balances.
    2.  Establish and implement a precise, behavioral definition of customer churn (cessation of both trades and logins) for predictive modeling across 90-day and 270-day windows.
    3.  Develop, evaluate, and tune machine learning models, focusing on Random Forest, to accurately forecast client churn likelihood within these specified windows.
    4.  Identify and analyze the key client behaviors and features most indicative of impending churn.
    5.  Propose a conceptual framework for the operationalization of these predictive models to support proactive customer retention strategies at Religare.\"

**9.5 Scope of the Project**

\"This project utilized historical data primarily from January 2021 through April 2024 (for raw activity), with client snapshots for the ABT generated up to April 2023. Key data inputs included Religare's internal records for client master information, trades, logins, deposits, payouts, AUM, and cash balances. All feature engineering and model development were conducted using PySpark within a Google Colab environment. The churn definition adopted was strictly behavioral. Initial analysis of official dormancy data was performed, but this data was excluded from the predictive model's target definition. Full-scale, real-time deployment and the development of specific retention campaign materials were outside the scope of this phase.\"

This is much better. It's clear, states the business pain point (reactive/inefficient efforts, missed opportunities) and then directly states how the project aims to solve it (develop a predictive model for data-driven interventions).

Thank you for the correction! This significantly improves the impact of this crucial part of the introduction.

    *   \"Raw activity data (trades, logins, funding) was available from approximately August 2020 through April 2024. The ABT was constructed using client snapshots from January 1, 2021, to April 30, 2023, to allow for sufficient future observation windows for churn label creation.\"

**10.2 Data Preprocessing & Analytical Base Table (ABT) Generation**

*   \"A robust data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline was developed using PySpark in a Google Colab environment to transform raw data into a model-ready Analytical Base Table (ABT).\"

    *   **10.2.1 Initial Data Extraction Strategy:**
        *   \"Initial data extraction from Religare's Oracle databases involved five curated SQL queries to pull relevant raw data into delimited text files (`.txt`). This approach was chosen over a single complex ABT generation query to manage complexity, improve performance, and allow for modular data loading in PySpark.\"

    *   **10.2.2 Snapshot Methodology:**
        *   \"The ABT was designed around a client-snapshot concept. Snapshots were generated at a monthly frequency (month-end dates) for each active client within the modeling period (January 2021 - April 2023). Each row in the ABT represents a unique client at a specific snapshot in time.\"

    *   **10.2.3 Churn Definition for Predictive Modeling:**
        *   \"A critical step was defining churn. After initial explorations, a behavioral definition was adopted for the predictive models, focusing on the cessation of key engagement activities. A client-snapshot was labeled as 'Churned' (`Is_Churned_Engage_XXXDays = 1`) for a given XXX-day window if both of the following conditions were met:\"
            *   \"**Condition A (Recent Engagement):** The client had at least one trade OR at least one login in the XXX days *leading up to* the `SnapshotDate`.\"
            *   \"**Condition B (Subsequent Inactivity):** The client had NO trades AND NO logins in the XXX days *following* the `SnapshotDate`.\"
        *   \"Otherwise, the client-snapshot was labeled as 'Not Churned' (0).\"
        *   \"Churn labels were generated for four distinct prediction windows: 60, 90, 270, and 365 days. The primary modeling efforts reported herein focus on the 90-day and 270-day windows.\"

    *   **10.2.4 Feature Engineering:**
        *   \"An extensive set of features was engineered to capture various dimensions of client behavior and history leading up to each snapshot date. These can be broadly categorized as:\"
            *   **Base Features:**
                *   `Tenure_Days`: Days between `ActivationDate` and `SnapshotDate`.
            *   **Recency Features:** Calculated as days between the `SnapshotDate` and the last occurrence of an activity.
                *   `Days_Since_Last_Trade`, `Days_Since_Last_Login`, `Days_Since_Last_Deposit`, `Days_Since_Last_Payout`.
            *   **Frequency Features:** Counts of distinct activity days and total transactions within various lookback periods (30, 90, 180, 270, 365 days prior to `SnapshotDate`).
                *   E.g., `Trade_Days_Count_90D`, `Login_Txns_Count_30D`.
            *   **Monetary Features:** Sums of financial values within lookback periods.
                *   E.g., `Trade_Sum_90D` (Gross Brokerage), `Deposit_Sum_180D`.
            *   **Funding Flow Features:** Derived from deposit and payout sums.
                *   E.g., `Net_Funding_Flow_90D`, `Payout_To_Deposit_Ratio_90D`.
            *   **AUM Features:** Based on the provided monthly AUM data.
                *   `AUM_SnapshotMonth_Monthly` (AUM for the month of the snapshot).
                *   `AUM_SnapshotMonth_RunningTotal` (Cumulative AUM up to the snapshot month).
            *   **Payout Risk Features (for analytical enrichment):**
                *   `Total_Payout_In_Snapshot_Month`.
                *   `CashBalance_EOM_PreviousMonth`.
                *   `Payout_As_Pct_Of_CashBalance`: Percentage of previous month's EOM cash balance paid out in the snapshot month.
                *   `Payout_Risk_Flag`: \"CHURNRISK\" if the above percentage exceeded 70%.
            *   **Delta Features:** Month-over-month change in key 90-day rolling metrics.
                *   E.g., `Trade_Days_90D_Delta`, `Login_Days_90D_Delta`, `Brokerage_Sum_90D_Delta`.
            *   **Historical Excel-Based Classification (for analytical enrichment):**
                *   The logic from an existing Excel-based client classification system was replicated historically.
                *   Features added: `Historical_Total_Score`, `Historical_Tag` (e.g., \"Classic\", \"Silver\", \"Gold\").
                *   The `Status Score` component of this classification was dynamically derived using the `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` label from the ABT (100 if not churned; 75/0 if churned, based on past trading). \"36M\" Excel inputs were proxied by 12-month (365D) ABT features.
        *   \"Null values in engineered features were handled systematically, typically by filling with 0 for counts/sums, or a large value (e.g., 9999) for recency features where no prior activity existed.\"
        *   *(A more detailed list of all final features can be found in Annexure A, if you choose to create one.)*

    *   **10.2.5 ABT Generation Strategy and Output:**
        *   \"Due to the large volume of data and the complexity of feature calculations, an iterative ABT generation strategy was employed. Intermediate stages of the ABT were written to and read from Parquet files on Google Drive to manage memory constraints within the Colab environment.\"
        *   \"The final ABT, containing approximately 33.2 million client-snapshot records and 94 columns (including features, identifiers, and churn labels), was saved in Parquet format.\"

**Next Steps for Section 10:**

1.  **Review 10.1 and 10.2:** Does this accurately capture the data and ABT generation process? Is the level of detail appropriate (not too verbose, not too sparse)?
2.  **Confirmation of Delimiters/Date Formats (if any were missed):** While we confirmed most, just a final check in your mind. For example, I used `dd-MMM-yy` for deposit/payout dates in `load_funding_data` based on typical Oracle extracts, but you later confirmed `dd/MM/yyyy` for payout. I've updated the `load_funding_data` in my mental model and previous code to use `dd/MM/yyyy` for both if that was the final confirmation. The text here is generic enough.
3.  **Proxy for \"36M\" in Excel Classification:** The text now clearly states the 12-month proxy was used.
4.  **Ready for 10.3 (EDA Insights)?**

The goal is to show how EDA informed our understanding of churn and guided the modeling approach.

---

**10.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Key Insights**

*   \"Prior to comprehensive feature engineering and modeling, several exploratory data analyses were conducted to understand fundamental client activity patterns and the nature of disengagement. These insights were instrumental in shaping the churn definition and focusing the feature engineering efforts.\"

    *   **10.3.1 Analysis of Inter-Trade Intervals (`00_explore_inter_trade_time.ipynb`):**
        *   \"An analysis of the time duration between consecutive trading days for all clients revealed a highly right-skewed distribution.\"
        *   **Key Finding:** While the overall average time between trades was approximately 8.14 days, the **median was only 2.00 days.**
        *   \"Furthermore, 75% of inter-trade periods were 4 days or less, and 95% were 23 days or less.\"
        *   **Implication:** This indicated that for a majority of active trading periods, clients trade quite frequently. Consequently, even relatively short periods of trading inactivity (e.g., >30 days) represent a significant deviation from typical behavior and could be early indicators of disengagement from trading.

    *   **10.3.2 Analysis of Time to First N-Day Inactivity (`01_explore_time_to_inactivity.ipynb`):**
        *   \"This analysis investigated how long it took for clients, from their activation date, to experience their first continuous N-day spell of *complete inactivity* (no trades AND no logins), for N = 60, 90, 270, and 365 days.\"
        *   **Key Finding:** For a very large proportion of clients who eventually exhibited such N-day inactivity, this period of inactivity **began on their activation day itself.** For example, over 75% of clients who experienced a 60-day or 90-day inactivity spell started this spell from day zero of their tenure. This pattern was even more pronounced for the 270-day and 365-day inactivity windows, where over 90% of those experiencing such long inactivity started it at activation.
        *   **Implication:** This highlighted a significant \"infant mortality\" or immediate disengagement pattern. It underscores the critical importance of successful client onboarding and early engagement in the first few days and weeks post-activation. It also suggested that features capturing very early lifecycle activity (or lack thereof) would be crucial for the predictive models.

    *   **10.3.3 Analysis of Inactivity Patterns (Trade vs. Login) (`02_explore_inactivity_patterns.ipynb`):**
        *   \"This analysis examined client-snapshots to determine, for future N-day windows, whether clients: a) stopped only trading, b) stopped only logging in, c) stopped both trading and logging in, or d) remained active in both.\"
        *   **Key Finding:** Across all tested future windows (60, 90, 270, 365 days), the most prevalent pattern of disengagement was **\"Stopped_Both\"** (no trades AND no logins). For instance, for a 60-day future window, approximately 68% of client-snapshots that showed any form of inactivity fell into the \"Stopped_Both\" category. For a 90-day window, this figure was approximately 64%.
        *   \"The next most common pattern was \"Stopped_Trading_Only\" (clients stopped trading but continued to log in), with its proportion increasing for longer windows.\"
        *   **Implication:** This finding strongly validated the project's refined churn definition, which requires the cessation of *both* trading and login activities. It confirmed that this combined inactivity is the most common way clients fully disengage, providing a robust target for prediction. It also highlighted the \"Stopped_Trading_Only\" segment as a distinct at-risk group.

    *   **Overall EDA Conclusion:**
        *   \"Collectively, these EDA insights emphasized the importance of recent and frequent engagement (both trades and logins), the critical nature of the early client lifecycle, and affirmed that a churn definition based on combined inactivity of trades and logins captures the most significant disengagement pathway. These findings directly guided the feature engineering process and the selection of churn windows for modeling.\"

---

**Review Points for Section 10.3:**

1.  **Accuracy of Metrics:** Double-check that the specific numbers (e.g., 8.14 days average, 2.00 days median, percentages for \"Stopped_Both\") accurately reflect the outputs from your exploratory notebooks.
2.  **Clarity of Implications:** Is it clear how each EDA finding influenced subsequent project decisions (churn definition, feature engineering focus)?
3.  **Conciseness:** Does it provide enough detail without being overly lengthy? The goal is to highlight the *key actionable insights* from the EDA.

This section will detail the strategy used for training and evaluating the predictive models.

---

**10.4 Modeling Approach**

*   \"Following the creation of the ABT and informed by EDA insights, a structured modeling approach was adopted to predict customer churn for the defined 90-day and 270-day windows. The primary tool for model development was PySpark's MLlib library.\"

    *   **10.4.1 Target Variables Modeled:**
        *   \"Two primary target variables from the ABT were selected for this phase of modeling:\"
            *   `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`: Indicating churn within 90 days.
            *   `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`: Indicating churn within 270 days.
        *   \"Models were developed and evaluated independently for each of these target variables.\"

    *   **10.4.2 Feature Selection for Modeling:**
        *   \"From the comprehensive ABT, a subset of 78 features was selected for model training. This selection excluded:\"
            *   Identifier columns (`ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate`, `ActivationDate`).
            *   Date columns used to derive recency features (e.g., `Last_Trade_Date`).
            *   Churn labels other than the specific target being modeled for a given run.
            *   Descriptive analytical columns not intended as direct predictive inputs in this iteration (e.g., `Payout_Risk_Flag`, `Historical_Tag`).
        *   \"The selected features primarily consisted of numerical data representing client tenure, recency of various activities, frequency counts and monetary sums over multiple lookback periods, funding flow metrics, AUM details, and delta features indicating trends.\" *(Refer to Annexure A for the full list if provided)*

    *   **10.4.3 Data Splitting Strategy:**
        *   \"A time-based train/test split was implemented to simulate a realistic prediction scenario where models are trained on past data to predict future outcomes.\"
        *   \"A specific `SnapshotDate` (`2023-03-01`) was chosen as the split point. All client-snapshots *before* this date constituted the training set, and snapshots *on or after* this date formed the test set.\"
        *   \"This resulted in approximately 92% of the data for training (approx. 30.7 million snapshots) and 8% for testing (approx. 2.5 million snapshots).\"
        *   \"To manage memory during model development in the Colab environment, the training and test DataFrames were written to and read from Parquet files on Google Drive after the split.\"

    *   **10.4.4 Feature Preparation for ML Models:**
        *   \"A standard two-stage feature preparation pipeline was applied using PySpark ML transformers:\"
            1.  **`VectorAssembler`**: All selected numerical feature columns were combined into a single vector column named `rawFeatures`. The `handleInvalid=\"skip\"` option was used, meaning rows with any null values in the selected feature columns would be skipped during assembly (though extensive `fillna` in the ABT generation aimed to minimize such instances).
            2.  **`StandardScaler`**: The `rawFeatures` vector was then scaled to have zero mean and unit standard deviation, producing a `scaledFeatures` vector. This standardization is beneficial for algorithms like Logistic Regression and can sometimes aid the convergence of tree-based models.

    *   **10.4.5 Machine Learning Algorithms Evaluated:**
        *   \"The following classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated:\"
            1.  **Logistic Regression:** Chosen as a robust and interpretable linear baseline model.
            2.  **Random Forest Classifier:** Selected for its ability to capture non-linearities and feature interactions, and its general robustness.
        *   *(Mention GBT was considered but not pursued in detail for this iteration if you want to be comprehensive: \"Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT) were also considered, but initial training attempts indicated significant computational demands exceeding the available resources for full dataset training in this project phase.\")*

    *   **10.4.6 Handling Class Imbalance:**
        *   \"The target churn labels exhibited significant class imbalance (e.g., for 90-day churn, approx. 1:42 churned vs. not-churned in training data; for 270-day churn, approx. 1:22).\"
        *   \"For **Logistic Regression**, this imbalance was explicitly addressed by applying class weights using the `weightCol` parameter. Weights were inversely proportional to class frequencies (e.g., `Weight_k = TotalSamples / (2 * SamplesInClass_k)`).\"
        *   \"For **Random Forest**, initial models were trained without explicit class weights to assess baseline performance, as tree ensembles can sometimes inherently handle moderate imbalance. (Note: The option to use `weightCol` with Random Forest exists for future iterations).\"

    *   **10.4.7 Hyperparameter Tuning (Random Forest):**
        *   \"To optimize the Random Forest model, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using PySpark's `TrainValidationSplit`.\"
        *   \"Due to the large training dataset size (~30 million snapshots), tuning was performed on a 5% random subsample of the training data to make the process computationally feasible.\"
        *   \"A small grid of key hyperparameters was explored: `numTrees` (number of trees), and `maxDepth` (maximum tree depth).\"
        *   \"The `areaUnderPR` (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve) was used as the primary evaluation metric for selecting the best hyperparameter combination during tuning, as it is more informative than AUC-ROC for imbalanced datasets.\"
        *   \"The best parameters identified on the sample were then used to train a final Random Forest model on the *full* training dataset.\"

    *   **10.4.8 Model Evaluation Metrics:**
        *   \"Model performance was assessed using a comprehensive set of metrics on the unseen test set:\"
            *   Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)
            *   Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR)
            *   Overall Accuracy
            *   Weighted Precision, Weighted Recall, Weighted F1-Score
            *   Confusion Matrix
            *   Specific Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for the churner class (Class 1), calculated from the confusion matrix. This was a key focus for understanding the model's ability to correctly identify actual churners.

**Review Points for Section 10.4:**

1.  **Accuracy of Details:** Ensure all specific choices (split date, percentage split, subsample fraction for tuning, tuning metric, model parameters mentioned) are accurate.
2.  **Clarity and Flow:** Does the section logically progress from target selection to evaluation metrics?
3.  **Completeness:** Does it cover all the important aspects of your modeling methodology?
4.  **Conciseness:** Is there any part that can be worded more directly without losing meaning? For example, the `VectorAssembler` detail on `handleInvalid=\"skip\"` is good because our `fillna` strategy in ABT generation aimed to make this safe.

This section sets up the \"how\" of your modeling. The next section, **10.5 Model Results & Discussion**, will present the \"what\" – the actual performance numbers and their interpretation.

            *   \"The 90-day model also exhibited excellent overall AUC-ROC. Its AUC-PR (0.6077), while good, was lower than the 270-day model, suggesting the precision-recall balance for this shorter-term churn is more challenging with the current setup. At the default threshold, the model identified 45.1% of actual 90-day churners with a precision of 63.6%.\"
        *   **Feature Importances (90-Day Model):**
            *   \"Feature importances for the 90-day model highlighted the criticality of more *recent* activity patterns:\"
                1.  `Login_Txns_Count_90D`
                2.  `Login_Days_Count_90D`
                3.  `Days_Since_Last_Login`
                4.  `Trade_Txns_Count_90D`
                5.  `Login_Days_Count_180D`
            *   \"This shift towards shorter-term lookbacks and recency underscores that predicting near-term churn (90 days) relies heavily on very current engagement signals.\" *(Refer to Annexure C for the full feature importance plot/table if needed).*
        *   **Threshold Analysis (90-Day Model):**
            *   \"Threshold analysis for the 90-day model (detailed in Cell 12 output) was particularly insightful. While the default 0.5 threshold yielded a recall of 45.1% for churners, lowering the threshold could significantly improve this. For example:\"
                *   \"At a threshold of **0.40**, Recall (Class 1) increased to ~63.3% with Precision (Class 1) at ~56.7%, achieving the peak F1-Score for churners (0.5977).\"
                *   \"At a threshold of **0.30**, Recall (Class 1) further increased to ~81.1% with Precision (Class 1) at ~47.1%.\"
            *   \"This demonstrates that the 90-day model can be tuned via its prediction threshold to serve as a more sensitive early warning system if the business prioritizes capturing a larger proportion of potentially churning clients, accepting a higher rate of false positives for this shorter window.\"

    *   **10.5.3 Comparative Discussion and Overall Insights:**
        *   \"Both the 90-day and 270-day Random Forest models provide strong predictive capabilities. The 270-day model, at its default threshold, offers higher recall for its target group (longer-term churners).\"
        *   \"The 90-day model, especially when its prediction threshold is adjusted (e.g., to 0.4), can effectively identify a majority of clients at risk of near-term churn with reasonable precision, making it suitable for timely interventions.\"
        *   \"The differing feature importances highlight that distinct behavioral patterns may precede short-term versus longer-term disengagement, reinforcing the value of having models for different prediction horizons.\"
        *   \"Login activity (both frequency and recency) consistently emerged as a top predictor across both models, emphasizing its critical role in client engagement beyond just trading.\"

**Review Points for Section 10.5:**

1.  **Accuracy of Metrics:** Ensure all numbers quoted directly match your final model outputs for both targets.
2.  **Clarity of Discussion:** Is the interpretation of performance, feature importances, and threshold analysis clear and logical?
3.  **Consistency:** Ensure the narrative flows well from one model to the next and then to the comparative discussion.
4.  **Visuals:** Plan where you would insert the feature importance plots and the threshold analysis plots (either directly in this section or referenced as figures from an annexure).
5.  **Threshold for 270D:** You'll need the results from running Cell 12 (Threshold Analysis) on the `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days` predictions to complete that part of 10.5.1. If you didn't run it, you can state that the default 0.5 was used and further threshold exploration is a next step for that model.

This section is about articulating the potential value and benefits of your churn prediction models to Religare. Since the models aren't fully deployed and measured in a live environment yet, much of this will be *potential* or *projected* impact, grounded in the model's performance.

---

**11. Impact (Potential Quantitative and Qualitative)**

*   \"The development of these churn prediction models offers Religare Broking Ltd. the potential for significant positive impact, both quantitatively in terms of financial metrics and qualitatively through improved customer understanding and operational efficiencies.\"

    *   **11.1 Potential Quantitative Impact:**
        *   *(This section requires making some reasonable assumptions or suggesting how Religare could quantify it. Be clear these are illustrative based on model performance.)*
        *   **Improved Customer Retention Rates:**
            *   \"By proactively identifying at-risk customers through the 90-day and 270-day churn models, Religare can implement targeted retention strategies. Even a modest improvement in the retention rate can translate to substantial financial benefits.\"
            *   \"**Illustrative Example:** If the 90-day model (at a 0.4 threshold) identifies [Number of True Positives at 0.4 threshold, e.g., ~26,000 from 41,237 actual 90D churners in test set] clients who are correctly predicted to churn, and a targeted intervention successfully retains even 10-20% of this group, this translates to [Calculate: (0.10 to 0.20) * TPs] clients retained. Multiplying this by the average lifetime value or average annual revenue per client would indicate the direct revenue preserved.\" *(You'd need an estimated average client value from Religare for a concrete number here, or state it as a formula they can use).*
        *   **Reduced Churn-Related Revenue Loss:**
            *   \"The models help quantify the segment of the client base at high risk. For instance, the 270-day model identified approximately 56,500 true positive churners in the test set (at 0.5 threshold). Understanding the typical brokerage generated by such clients allows for an estimation of revenue potentially saved by successful interventions.\"
        *   **Optimized Allocation of Retention Budgets:**
            *   \"With predictive scores, retention efforts can be focused on clients with a high probability of churn *and* high value, rather than broad, less effective campaigns. This leads to a more efficient use of marketing and retention resources.\"
            *   \"For example, the 270-day Random Forest model (at 0.5 threshold) had a precision of ~64% for churners. This means nearly two-thirds of clients flagged for high-cost interventions would be correctly identified, reducing wastage on clients who were not going to churn anyway.\"
        *   **Reduced Customer Acquisition Costs (Long-Term):**
            *   \"By improving retention, the need to acquire new customers to replace churned ones decreases over time, leading to savings on Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC), which are typically higher than retention costs.\"

    *   **11.2 Potential Qualitative Impact:**
        *   **Enhanced Customer Understanding:**
            *   \"The feature importance analysis (detailed in Section 10.5) provides deep insights into the behaviors and characteristics most strongly associated with churn (e.g., declining login frequency, reduced trading activity, recency of interactions). This understanding can inform product development, service improvements, and communication strategies.\"
        *   **Proactive vs. Reactive Customer Management:**
            *   \"The models enable a shift from a reactive approach (addressing churn after it happens) to a proactive one (intervening before the client is lost), which is generally more effective and fosters better customer relationships.\"
        *   **Improved Customer Experience:**
            *   \"Targeted interventions can be designed to address specific pain points or needs of at-risk clients, potentially improving their overall experience and satisfaction with Religare's platform and services.\"
        *   **Data-Driven Decision Making:**
            *   \"The project establishes a framework for data-driven decision-making within retention and client management functions. Performance metrics from the models provide a clear basis for evaluating the effectiveness of different intervention strategies.\"
        *   **Strategic Resource Allocation:**
            *   \"Insights from the model can help prioritize development efforts or service enhancements in areas that most impact client engagement and reduce churn drivers.\"
        *   **Competitive Advantage:**
            *   \"Leveraging advanced analytics for customer retention can provide Religare with a competitive edge in a crowded broking market.\"

    *   **11.3 Measuring Actual Impact (Future Recommendation):**
        *   \"To quantify the true impact, it is recommended to implement the model predictions in a pilot program using A/B testing. A segment of at-risk clients (identified by the model) would receive retention interventions, while a control group (also at-risk but receiving no special intervention) would be monitored. Comparing the churn rates between these groups over time would provide a direct measure of the model's effectiveness and the ROI of retention campaigns.\"

---

**Review Points for Section 11:**

1.  **Plausibility of Quantitative Examples:** The examples are illustrative. If Religare can provide even rough estimates for \"average client value\" or \"cost of an intervention,\" the quantitative impact statements can be made more concrete. Otherwise, framing them as \"potential based on X% success rate\" is appropriate.
2.  **Focus on \"Potential\":** Since this is based on a model developed during an internship and not yet fully deployed and measured over a long period, using words like \"potential,\" \"can lead to,\" \"offers the opportunity\" is important.
3.  **Alignment with Business Goals:** Ensure the described impacts align with what would be considered valuable by Religare.
4.  **Actionable Recommendation (11.3):** The suggestion for a pilot program is a standard and good way to move towards realizing and measuring the impact.

---

**Revised Section 11.1: Potential Quantitative Impact**

*   \"The deployment of the developed churn prediction models has the potential to yield significant quantitative benefits for Religare Broking Ltd. by enabling more effective customer retention. While specific internal financial metrics are proprietary, the following illustrations utilize industry benchmarks for Indian discount and full-service brokers to demonstrate potential impact:\"

    *   **11.1.1 Improved Customer Retention and Revenue Preservation:**
        *   \"The models identify clients at high risk of ceasing activity. For instance, the tuned Random Forest model for 270-day churn identified 56,483 True Positives (clients correctly predicted to churn who indeed churned) in the test set with a recall of 71.1% (at a 0.5 threshold). The 90-day model (at a 0.4 threshold, achieving ~63% recall) identified a different cohort of early-stage at-risk clients.\"
        *   \"**Illustrative Impact:** If targeted interventions based on these predictions could successfully retain even a conservative 10% of these correctly identified at-risk clients:\"
            *   \"For the 270-day window, this would mean retaining approximately 5,648 clients (`0.10 * 56,483`).\"
            *   \"Industry estimates for annual revenue per active client for discount brokers range from ₹1,000 to ₹2,500. Assuming a conservative average annual revenue of ₹1,500 per client, retaining these 5,648 clients could preserve approximately **₹84.7 lakhs in annual revenue** (`5,648 * ₹1,500`). For full-service brokers, this figure could be higher due to typically larger revenue per client.\"
            *   \"Over a client's lifetime (with CLV estimates for active traders ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹25,000), the long-term value preserved would be substantially greater.\"

    *   **11.1.2 Optimization of Retention Budgets:**
        *   \"Predictive scoring allows for more focused allocation of retention resources. Instead of broad campaigns, efforts can be concentrated on clients who are both high-value and high-risk.\"
        *   \"The tuned 270-day Random Forest model achieved a precision of ~63.85% for churners (at a 0.5 threshold). This means that for every 100 clients flagged for retention efforts, approximately 64 would be correctly identified churn risks. This level of precision significantly reduces expenditure on clients who were unlikely to churn, leading to a more efficient use of retention budgets compared to untargeted approaches.\"

    *   **11.1.3 Long-Term Reduction in Effective Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC):**
        *   \"Industry estimates for CAC for discount brokers in India range from ₹500 to ₹1,500 per client. By improving client retention, the churn rate is reduced. A lower churn rate diminishes the constant pressure to acquire new customers merely to replace those lost.\"
        *   \"Over time, successful retention strategies fueled by predictive insights can lead to a more stable client base, thereby reducing the overall proportion of the marketing budget spent on replacing churned clients and effectively lowering the net cost of maintaining a desired active client volume.\"

    *   **11.1.4 Increased Client Lifetime Value (CLV):**
        *   \"By identifying and intervening with at-risk clients earlier (e.g., using the 90-day model), Religare has the opportunity to resolve issues, re-engage clients, and extend their active trading lifetime. Each client retained translates directly into an extended period of revenue generation, thereby increasing the average CLV.\"

---

**Key Changes in this Revised 11.1:**

*   **Clear Disclaimer:** States that industry benchmarks are used for illustration.
*   **Concrete Examples:** Uses the True Positive numbers from your 270D model (and refers to the 90D model's potential) to ground the retention example.
*   **Incorporated Your Figures:** Directly uses the ₹1,000-₹2,500 annual revenue, the CLV range, and the CAC range you provided.
*   **Calculated Potential Revenue Preserved:** Shows a sample calculation.
*   **Focus on Efficiency:** Highlights how precision helps optimize budget.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** Connects retention to CAC and CLV.

This version of 11.1 should be much more impactful as it grounds the potential benefits in relatable industry figures.

        *   **Large-Scale Data Processing with PySpark:**
            *   \"Gained extensive hands-on experience in using Apache PySpark for end-to-end data processing, including loading diverse data sources, complex data transformations, extensive feature engineering (recency, frequency, monetary, deltas, etc.), and building scalable machine learning pipelines.\"
            *   \"Developed a crucial understanding of managing memory constraints (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`) in PySpark, particularly within the Google Colab environment. This involved implementing strategies such as iterative processing with intermediate disk writes (to Parquet), judicious use of `.persist()` and `.unpersist()`, DataFrame aliasing for complex joins, and query optimization.\"
        *   **Machine Learning Model Implementation & Evaluation:**
            *   \"Successfully implemented and evaluated multiple classification algorithms from PySpark MLlib, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.\"
            *   \"Gained practical experience in handling highly imbalanced datasets, primarily through class weighting (`weightCol`) for Logistic Regression and understanding the inherent capabilities and evaluation nuances for tree-based ensembles.\"
            *   \"Mastered techniques for robust model evaluation, emphasizing metrics beyond accuracy, such as AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and class-specific precision, recall, and F1-scores, which are critical for imbalanced churn data.\"
        *   **Hyperparameter Tuning for Large Datasets:**
            *   \"Learned and applied strategies for efficient hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using `TrainValidationSplit` with subsampling of training data) when dealing with large datasets where full k-fold cross-validation on extensive grids is computationally prohibitive.\"
        *   **Feature Importance Analysis:**
            *   \"Utilized Random Forest's feature importance capabilities to identify key drivers of churn, translating model outputs into interpretable business insights.\"

            *   \"Reinforced the importance of thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in understanding data characteristics (e.g., inter-activity times, inactivity patterns) and how these insights directly inform churn definition and feature engineering strategies. Utilized visualization for presenting EDA findings and model results.\"

    *   **12.2 Business and Domain Learnings (Broking Industry & Churn):**
        *   **Understanding Churn Drivers:**
            *   \"Gained a deeper appreciation for the behavioral indicators of customer churn in the broking sector. Consistently observed the paramount importance of client engagement, particularly login frequency and recency, alongside trading activity.\"
            *   \"Recognized the significance of 'infant mortality' – a substantial portion of eventual churn (defined by prolonged inactivity) begins very early in the client lifecycle, highlighting the critical nature of effective onboarding and early engagement.\"
        *   **Nuances of Churn Definition:**
            *   \"Learned that defining 'churn' is a critical and nuanced step. The iterative process leading to the adopted behavioral definition (cessation of both trades and logins after recent engagement) was a key learning in ensuring the model addresses a meaningful business problem.\"
            *   \"Understood the value of predicting churn across different time windows (e.g., 90-day vs. 270-day) as they cater to different business intervention strategies (early warning vs. identifying deeply disengaged clients).\"
        *   **Impact of Model Performance Metrics on Business Decisions:**
            *   \"Developed a strong understanding of how different metrics (e.g., precision vs. recall for the churner class) translate to different business implications and costs (e.g., cost of false positives vs. cost of false negatives). Learned the importance of threshold analysis in tailoring model output for specific business objectives.\"
        *   **Value of Data-Driven Retention:**
            *   \"Solidified the understanding of how predictive analytics can transform customer retention from a reactive to a proactive, data-informed strategic function.\"

    *   **12.3 Project Management and Personal Development:**

        *   **A: Detailed List of ABT Features** (highly recommended for completeness).
        *   **B & C: Full Feature Importance lists/plots** (good supporting evidence).
    *   Others are optional based on how much detail you want to provide and what supports your main narrative best.
    *   You will need to generate these (e.g., export the feature list from your ABT schema, save the full importance DataFrames).

With these two sections planned, you have the complete structure for your report. The main effort now is the actual drafting of content for Sections 9, 10, 11, and 12, and then compiling the references and annexures.

 Task A:

1.	Task or Problem Being Solved
The primary objective was twofold:
a) To segment and prioritize clients for targeted marketing of Margin Trading Facility (MTF) services at Religare Broking Ltd.
b) To initiate a churn prediction model aimed at estimating the percentage of dormant clients from the active client base by the end of the next financial year.
2.	Tools, Platforms, or Technologies Used
•	SQL: Used for querying and extracting data from the Oracle-based database (biuser.tblclientdetail).
•	Python (planned for later stages): Intended for advanced analytics and predictive modeling.
•	VS Code: Used as the development environment for SQL and Python scripts.
•	Oracle Database: Primary source of client data.
3.	Steps or Methods Followed
A. For Client Segmentation & MTF Marketing:
•	Identified three client categories:
i. Active traders not enabled for MTF
ii. Dormant traders
iii. MTF-enabled clients not actively using the feature
•	Used SQL queries to extract relevant data and assign prioritization scores based on trading frequency (LASTTRADEDATE), revenue contribution (BROKTILLDATE), and MTF status (MTFENABLED).
•	Grouped clients by AGEINYEARS and SERVICEZONE to understand behavior by demographics and geography.
B. For Dormancy Forecasting:
•	Defined dormancy percentage as:
% Dormancy = (Number of clients active last FY but dormant this FY) / (Number of clients active last FY)
•	Chose regression and exponential smoothing as forecasting methods for dormancy trend prediction.
•	Decided to use SQL for initial extraction of client activity status by financial year, followed by time series modeling in Python.
4.	Final Result or Solution
•	Developed a SQL-based client segmentation and prioritization framework for MTF marketing.
•	Outlined a data-driven approach to calculate and forecast client dormancy percentages using historical active/dormant statuses.
•	Prepared for predictive modeling using regression and smoothing techniques.
5.	Challenges and Solutions
•	Challenge: SQL errors due to invalid data types (e.g., interpreting VARCHAR2 columns like MTFENABLED and DATE fields incorrectly).
Solution: Validated data types, corrected WHERE clause conditions, and ensured proper handling of DATE and VARCHAR2 fields.
•	Challenge: Determining the correct sequence of steps for segmentation and prioritization.
Solution: Followed a structured, data-first approach, ensuring segmentation precedes prioritization and hypothesis incorporation.
•	Challenge: Ensuring data privacy while testing SQL queries.
Solution: Avoided sharing raw outputs; only discussed query logic and structure.

Task B:

Internship Report Summary: Google Forms Enhancement and Design
1. Task or Problem Being Solved:
The primary objective evolved through the conversation:
•	Initial Task: To create a Google Form where the user could preview all their entered data and edit it before final submission.
•	Revised Task (Primary Focus): To design a Google Form that implements conditional logic, where specific questions or sections are shown to the user based on their answers to previous questions. This was in the context of replicating a complex data entry structure (provided as a spreadsheet image) into a dynamic Google Form.
•	Subsidiary Task: To enforce a specific input format for a \"Client Code\" field within the Google Form.
2. Tools, Platforms, or Technologies Used/Discussed:
•	Google Forms: The primary platform for form creation and deployment.
•	Google Forms Features:
o	Sections
o	Conditional Branching (\"Go to section based on answer\")
o	Response Validation (specifically using Regular Expressions)
•	Google Apps Script (Discussed as an alternative): Explored as a potential solution for the initial preview/edit requirement, involving building a custom Web App with HTML Service.
•	Google AppSheet (Discussed as an alternative): Explored as another potential solution for the preview/edit requirement, involving custom app creation based on a Google Sheet, using views, actions, and a \"draft\" status.
•	Third-Party Form Builders (Mentioned briefly): Considered as general alternatives that might offer built-in preview functionality.
•	Regular Expressions (Regex): Used as a method within Google Forms for input format validation.
3. Exact Steps or Methods Followed:
•	For Pre-Submission Preview & Edit (Initial Requirement - Ultimately Pivoted Away From):
1.	Google Forms Native Limitations: Identified that Google Forms does not have a built-in full preview page before submission. Workarounds like using sections with the \"Back\" button and enabling post-submission editing were discussed.
2.	Google Apps Script Approach: Explored creating a custom Web App that would replicate the form fields, use client-side JavaScript for an on-page preview, and then submit data to a Google Sheet via a server-side Apps Script function.
3.	Google AppSheet Approach: Discussed creating a custom AppSheet application. This involved:
	Setting up a Google Sheet with a \"Status\" column (e.g., \"Draft,\" \"Submitted\").
	Designing AppSheet views (Form for entry, Detail for preview).
	Creating AppSheet actions to save as draft, navigate to preview, allow editing of draft, and finally submit (changing status).
4.	Other Alternatives: Briefly mentioned third-party form builders.
•	For Conditional Logic in Google Forms (Revised Primary Focus):
1.	Understanding Requirements: Analyzed the provided spreadsheet image to determine data fields and desired workflow.
2.	Section Planning: Broke down the form into logical sections based on the conditional flow derived from the spreadsheet (e.g., \"Basic Information,\" \"Connected Call Details,\" \"Not Connected Call Details,\" \"Purpose of Call,\" etc.).
3.	Identifying Branching Questions: Determined which questions (e.g., \"Calling Status,\" \"Main Purpose of Call\") would trigger different paths. These were designated as Multiple Choice or Dropdown types.
4.	Implementing Branching:
	For each branching question, the \"Go to section based on answer\" feature was enabled.
	Each answer option was linked to direct the user to the appropriate subsequent section.
5.	Managing Section Exits: Configured the \"After section...\" setting at the end of each section to ensure users were correctly navigated to the next relevant section or to the submit page, bypassing irrelevant conditional sections.
6.	Detailed Form Structure Design: A complete, multi-section form layout with specific questions, question types, and branching logic was proposed to replicate the spreadsheet's information flow.
•	For Client Code Format Validation:
1.	Identifying the Need: User requested to enforce a specific format for the \"Client Code\" field.
2.	Using Response Validation: The \"Response validation\" feature in Google Forms was selected for the \"Client Code\" question.
3.	Applying Regular Expressions: The \"Regular expression\" option within response validation was chosen, with the \"Matches\" condition.
4.	Pattern Definition: A specific regular expression pattern (^[A-Z]{2}\\d{5}$) was provided to match the example format (e.g., AB12345).
5.	Custom Error Message: A user-friendly error message was recommended to guide the form-filler if their input didn't match the required format.
4. Final Result or Solution:
•	The primary focus shifted away from the pre-submission preview functionality due to its complexity within Google Forms.
•	The key outcome was a detailed plan and methodology for constructing a Google Form with advanced conditional logic. This involved structuring the form into multiple sections and using the \"Go to section based on answer\" feature to guide users through different question paths based on their previous responses, effectively replicating the desired workflow from the user's spreadsheet.
•	A solution for input validation was provided, demonstrating how to use regular expressions within Google Forms' response validation to ensure the \"Client Code\" field adhered to a specific format.
5. Challenges and How They Were Solved/Addressed:
•	Challenge: Implementing a pre-submission preview and edit feature directly within Google Forms' standard interface.
o	Solution/Address: It was determined that Google Forms lacks this native capability. Alternatives like Google Apps Script and Google AppSheet were explored as more complex development solutions. The user ultimately decided to proceed without this feature for the immediate task and focus on conditional logic within Google Forms.
•	Challenge: Creating a dynamic form flow where questions change based on user input.
o	Solution: Leveraged Google Forms' built-in \"Sections\" and \"Go to section based on answer\" (conditional branching) functionality. A detailed step-by-step method for structuring the form with these features was provided.
•	Challenge: Ensuring data integrity by enforcing a specific format for certain input fields (e.g., Client Code).
o	Solution: Utilized Google Forms' \"Response validation\" feature, specifically with \"Regular expressions,\" to define and enforce the required input pattern, along with custom error messages for user guidance.

Here's how we can structure the text for Section 8, incorporating these tasks. I'll aim for a slightly more formal and condensed tone suitable for a report, while still capturing the essence of your detailed descriptions.

---

**Draft for Section 8 (incorporating Task A & B):**

**8. Internship Role, Responsibilities, and Contributions**

**8.1 Primary Role and Responsibilities: Churn Prediction Project**
    *   *(This is where you detail your main responsibilities for the churn project as previously planned: e.g., \"As an MBA Intern focused on Data Analytics, my primary responsibility was the end-to-end development of a predictive model for customer churn at Religare Broking Ltd. This encompassed data extraction and preprocessing from Oracle databases and diverse text-based sources, extensive feature engineering using PySpark, exploratory data analysis to understand client behavior, training and evaluation of machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), hyperparameter tuning, and the interpretation of model results to derive actionable business insights. The project also involved conceptualizing a deployment strategy for the developed models.\")*

**8.2 Reporting Structure, Team Collaboration, and Project Management**
    *   *(You'll fill this with details like:)*
        *   \"During the internship, I reported to [Mentor's/Supervisor's Name and Title].\"
        *   \"The project involved collaboration with [mention teams if any, e.g., the Data Engineering team for data access, and discussions with the Business Analytics team for understanding churn impact].\"
        *   \"This churn prediction initiative was designated as my major project, requiring independent research, problem-solving, and iterative development.\"
        *   *(If team size is relevant: \"I was part of a [e.g., data science/analytics] team of [X] members, though the churn project was primarily an individual endeavor under supervision.\")*

**8.3 Other Key Contributions and Skill Application**
    *   \"Beyond the primary churn modeling project, the internship provided opportunities to apply analytical and automation skills to address other operational needs within Religare Broking Ltd.:\"

        *   **8.3.1 Client Segmentation and Prioritization for Margin Trading Facility (MTF) Marketing (Task A):**
            *   **Objective:** To segment clients for targeted MTF service marketing and to initiate a preliminary framework for a churn prediction model focused on estimating dormant client percentages.
            *   **Methodology & Tools:** Utilized SQL extensively for data extraction and querying from Religare's Oracle database (specifically `biuser.tblclientdetail`). Client segmentation was performed by identifying active non-MTF traders, dormant traders, and MTF-enabled but inactive clients. Prioritization scores were developed based on trading frequency (`LASTTRADEDATE`), revenue contribution (`BROKTILLDATE`), and MTF status (`MTFENABLED`), with further grouping by client age and service zone. For dormancy forecasting, a definition based on year-over-year activity status was formulated, with regression and exponential smoothing identified as potential modeling techniques using SQL for data extraction and Python for subsequent time-series analysis.
            *   **Outcome & Solutions:** Developed a SQL-based framework for MTF client targeting. Outlined a data-driven approach for forecasting client dormancy. Challenges related to SQL data type interpretation and query sequencing were resolved through systematic validation and a structured data-first approach. Data privacy was maintained by focusing on logic and structure rather than sharing raw outputs during query development.

        *   **8.3.2 Enhancement and Design of Google Forms for Data Collection (Task B):**
            *   **Objective:** To design a Google Form with conditional logic to replicate a complex data entry workflow, thereby improving data collection efficiency and accuracy, and to enforce specific input formats.
            *   **Methodology & Tools:** The primary solution involved leveraging Google Forms' features, including Sections, conditional branching (\"Go to section based on answer\"), and Response Validation with Regular Expressions. While alternatives like Google Apps Script and AppSheet were explored for more advanced features like pre-submission preview (an initial requirement that was later de-prioritized), the core solution focused on maximizing native Google Forms capabilities.
            *   **Outcome & Solutions:** A detailed methodology was provided for constructing a multi-section Google Form with advanced conditional logic, guiding users through different question paths based on their prior responses. A specific solution using regular expressions (e.g., `^[A-Z]{2}\\d{5}$`) was implemented for \"Client Code\" input validation, enhancing data integrity. The challenge of native pre-submission preview was addressed by acknowledging limitations and focusing on the achievable conditional logic within Google Forms.

        *   *(Leave placeholder for more minor tasks if you have them:)*
            *   **8.3.3 [Title of Task C]**
                *   **Objective:**
                *   **Methodology & Tools:**
                *   **Outcome & Solutions:**

    *   \"These additional tasks allowed for the practical application of SQL, Python, Google AppScript (for email automation if applicable), and problem-solving skills in diverse business contexts, contributing to operational improvements within various teams.\"

---

**Key Changes and Why:**

*   **Sub-sectioning within 8.3:** Gives each task its own clear heading.
*   **Structured Information:** For each task, I've tried to pull out Objective, Methodology/Tools, and Outcome/Solutions, mirroring your detailed input but in a slightly more condensed report style.
*   **Focus on Skills and Impact:** The language aims to highlight the skills you used (SQL, Python, problem-solving, understanding requirements) and the positive outcomes or solutions delivered.
*   **Integration:** The final paragraph of 8.3 ties these tasks back to your broader skill development.

**How to Proceed:**

1.  **Review this Draft of Section 8:**
    *   Does it accurately and effectively represent your contributions for Task A and Task B?
    *   Is the level of detail appropriate for this section, keeping in mind the main focus is the churn project?
    *   Fill in any bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[Team Name/Function]`).
2.  **Provide Details for Other Minor Tasks:** If you have more, provide summaries similar to what you did for Task A and B, and we can integrate them as 8.3.3, 8.3.4, etc.
3.  **Finalize Your Own Details for 8.1 and 8.2:** Ensure your primary role, reporting structure, etc., are clearly articulated.

Once Section 8 is complete with all your contributions (major and minor), the report will have a very strong section showcasing your overall internship experience. After that, we can loop back to finishing Section 10 (10.4 Modeling Approach, 10.5 Results for 90D if not already drafted by you from our previous model outputs) and then Sections 11, 12, 13, 14."""),

Project Summary: Automation of Email Reporting at Religare Broking Ltd
1. Task or Problem Statement
During my internship at Religare Broking Ltd., I was assigned the task of automating the internal reporting and follow-up email process. The manual approach previously used was time-consuming and prone to errors, especially in tracking pending tasks and distributing daily or periodic summaries to employees and stakeholders. The objective was to automate:
•	Sending a formatted summary table from a Google Sheet via email.
•	Attaching the same report as an Excel file.
•	Personalizing reminder emails to employees based on pending tasks.
•	Ensuring visual formatting from the Google Sheet was retained in the email body.
________________________________________
2. Tools, Platforms, and Technologies Used
To implement the automation effectively, I used the following tools and technologies:
•	Google Sheets: Used as the central database for tracking summaries and pending tasks.
•	Google Apps Script: The core platform used for scripting the automation. It allowed manipulation of Sheets, formatting data, generating HTML emails, and sending them via Gmail.
•	Gmail Service (MailApp and GmailApp): Utilized for sending automated and personalized emails.
•	Google Drive API: Used to export Google Sheets content as an Excel file (.xlsx) and attach it to emails.
•	HTML & JavaScript (within Apps Script): Used to dynamically create HTML tables that replicate the formatting of the spreadsheet.
________________________________________
3. Step-by-Step Methodology
Step 1: Identify Data Sources
•	The data to be emailed was found in a sheet named \"Summary\", with the relevant range being C3:K11.
•	Another sheet, \"mailbody\", contained a list of employees (EMPName), their respective pending mail counts, and their email addresses in a column labeled maiIDs.
Step 2: Script for Sending Summary Report
•	Created a Google Apps Script function named sendSheetWithExcelAttachment().
•	Extracted:
o	Cell values, background colors, merged cell data, font weight, column widths, and row heights.
•	Constructed an HTML <table> string to reflect the exact formatting as visible in Google Sheets.
•	Ensured merged cells retained their correct colspan, and formatting such as bold text and cell background colors was preserved.
•	Sent the HTML table in the email body.
•	Used the Google Drive API to export the same Google Sheet as an .xlsx file and attached it to the email.
•	Configured the final email with:
o	Subject: Pending Mail Status
o	CC: hoshiyar.gusain@religare.com
o	Recipient: deepak.rastogi@religare.com
o	Body: Here is the Pending Mail Summary as of now.
Step 3: Automate Personalized Emails to Employees
•	Created a new script to read from the mailbody sheet.
•	Fetched values of EMPName, Pending count, and maiIDs.
•	Created a loop to send individualized emails to each employee:
o	Body of the email:

Report Section: Automation of Daily Market Turnover Data Collection and Consolidation
1. Introduction
During my internship at Religare Broking Ltd., a key task was to develop an automated solution for the daily collection and consolidation of market turnover data from multiple external sources. The objective was to create a reliable, centralized data repository to support [mention the specific analysis, e.g., \"market trend analysis,\" \"liquidity assessment,\" \"risk management processes,\" or \" MIS reporting\"]. Previously, this data was [briefly mention old method if known, e.g., \"manually aggregated\" or \"sourced from disparate systems,\" leading to inefficiencies and potential inconsistencies].
2. Methodology and Approach
The project was executed through a structured methodology involving requirements gathering, tool selection, development, testing, and deployment preparation:
Requirements Definition: The primary requirement was to fetch daily turnover data from four specific sources: NSE Cash Market (CM), NSE Futures & Options (F&O), BSE Equity, and BSE F&O. The consolidated data needed to be stored historically in a single Excel sheet (\"Master_data\") with columns for \"Exchange Code,\" \"Date,\" and \"Turnover,\" starting from April 1, 2025. The system needed to append new daily data and automatically refresh the data for the four preceding trading days to ensure accuracy and capture any revisions from the sources.
Tool Selection: Python was chosen as the primary development language due to its robust data handling libraries (Pandas, Openpyxl), web interaction capabilities (Requests, Selenium), and suitability for automation. Selenium was specifically selected for BSE websites requiring browser interaction, while direct API calls were used for NSE data.
Development Phases:
Individual Scrapers: Initial development focused on creating separate Python scripts for each of the four data sources. This allowed for tailored data extraction logic:
NSE CM & F&O: Utilized the requests library to interact with NSE's historical data APIs, parsing JSON responses to extract date and turnover figures. Session management, including initial page visits to acquire necessary cookies, was implemented.
BSE Equity & F&O: Employed the selenium library to automate browser interactions, navigating through web pages, handling dynamic content (year/month clicks for Equity, date range submission for F&O), and parsing HTML tables using BeautifulSoup to extract the required data points.
Master Script Consolidation: The individual scripts were integrated into a single, automated master Python script (Master_Scraper.py). This script orchestrates the entire process:
It reads the existing \"Master_data\" Excel sheet to determine the last recorded date.
It calculates the date range for fetching new data (from the day after the last recorded date up to the current day).
It iteratively calls the appropriate scraper function for each of the four sources for this new date range.
It then calculates a separate date range for the four days preceding the current date and re-fetches data for all four sources for this period.
All fetched data (new and re-fetched) is combined with the existing data.
The combined dataset is sorted by date and exchange code, and duplicates are removed, ensuring that the re-fetched data for the last four days overwrites any previous entries for those specific dates due to the keep='last' strategy in deduplication.
The final, consolidated dataset is written back to the \"Master_data\" sheet, replacing its previous content.
Excel Query Integration: To facilitate easier analysis and reporting, an Excel Power Query was set up in the same workbook. This query sources data from the \"Master_data\" sheet, transforms data types (e.g., converting text dates to date format, text turnover to numerical format), and loads the cleaned data into a new sheet, providing a stable and correctly formatted table for downstream use in PivotTables or further analysis.
Testing and Refinement: The script underwent iterative testing to handle various scenarios, including empty initial files, API response changes, website structure variations, and error handling for network issues or unavailable data. Adjustments were made to selectors, wait times, and date parsing logic based on these tests.
3. Key Insights and Conclusions
Automation Feasibility: The project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of automating the collection of complex, multi-source market data using Python.
Data Integrity and Recency: The strategy of appending new data and systematically re-fetching the most recent four days' data ensures both historical completeness and the accuracy of recent figures, accommodating potential revisions at the source.
Efficiency Gains: Automation significantly reduces the manual effort and time previously required for data aggregation, minimizing the risk of human error and ensuring timely availability of data.
Centralized Data Source: The \"Master_data\" sheet, coupled with the Power Query-driven analytical sheet, provides a single source of truth for this critical dataset, improving consistency for all dependent analyses.
Scalability (Potential): The modular design of the Python script (using a configuration list for sources and separate scraper functions) provides a foundation that can be extended to include additional data sources or different data points with relative ease.
4. Impact and Recommendations
The successful implementation of this automated data collection system has a direct positive impact on:
Data-Driven Decision Making: Providing timely, accurate, and consolidated turnover data enables more informed analysis for [mention specific areas again, e.g., \"trading strategy development,\" \"market surveillance,\" \"product performance tracking,\" or \"regulatory reporting\"].
Operational Efficiency: Frees up analyst time from manual data gathering to focus on value-added analysis and interpretation.
Data Quality and Reliability: Reduces the likelihood of errors inherent in manual processes and ensures consistency in the data used across different functions.
It is recommended that this automated script be scheduled to run daily (e.g., via Windows Task Scheduler or a similar cron-like utility) to maintain an up-to-date data repository. Further enhancements could include more sophisticated error alerting, database integration for larger-scale storage, or direct API outputs for other internal systems.

**Updated Draft for Section 8 (incorporating Tasks A, B, C, & D):**

**8. Internship Role, Responsibilities, and Contributions**

**8.1 Primary Role and Responsibilities: Churn Prediction Project**
    *   *(As drafted previously: \"As an MBA Intern focused on Data Analytics, my primary responsibility was the end-to-end development of a predictive model for customer churn at Religare Broking Ltd. This encompassed data extraction and preprocessing from Oracle databases and diverse text-based sources, extensive feature engineering using PySpark, exploratory data analysis to understand client behavior, training and evaluation of machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), hyperparameter tuning, and the interpretation of model results to derive actionable business insights. The project also involved conceptualizing a deployment strategy for the developed models.\")*

**8.2 Reporting Structure, Team Collaboration, and Project Management**
    *   *(As drafted previously, filled with your specifics:)*
        *   \"During the internship, I reported to [Mentor's/Supervisor's Name and Title].\"
        *   \"The project involved collaboration with [mention teams if any, e.g., the Data Engineering team for data access, and discussions with the Business Analytics team for understanding churn impact].\"
        *   \"This churn prediction initiative was designated as my major project, requiring independent research, problem-solving, and iterative development.\"
        *   *(Team size if relevant)*

**8.3 Other Key Contributions and Skill Application**
    *   \"Beyond the primary churn modeling project, the internship provided opportunities to apply analytical and automation skills to address other operational needs and enhance data-driven processes within Religare Broking Ltd.:\"

        *   **8.3.1 Client Segmentation and Prioritization for Margin Trading Facility (MTF) Marketing (Task A):**
            *   **Objective:** To segment clients for targeted MTF service marketing and to initiate a preliminary framework for a churn prediction model focused on estimating dormant client percentages.
            *   **Methodology & Tools:** Utilized SQL extensively for data extraction and querying from Religare's Oracle database. Client segmentation was performed by identifying active non-MTF traders, dormant traders, and MTF-enabled but inactive clients. Prioritization scores were developed based on trading frequency, revenue contribution, and MTF status, with further grouping by client age and service zone. For dormancy forecasting, a definition based on year-over-year activity status was formulated, with regression and exponential smoothing identified as potential modeling techniques.
            *   **Outcome & Solutions:** Developed a SQL-based framework for MTF client targeting and outlined a data-driven approach for forecasting client dormancy. Challenges related to SQL data type interpretation and query sequencing were resolved through systematic validation.

        *   **8.3.2 Enhancement and Design of Google Forms for Data Collection (Task B):**
            *   **Objective:** To design a Google Form with conditional logic to replicate a complex data entry workflow and to enforce specific input formats, thereby improving data collection efficiency and accuracy.
            *   **Methodology & Tools:** The solution involved leveraging Google Forms' features, including Sections, conditional branching (\"Go to section based on answer\"), and Response Validation with Regular Expressions. Alternatives like Google Apps Script and AppSheet were explored for more advanced initial requirements.
            *   **Outcome & Solutions:** A detailed methodology was provided for constructing a multi-section Google Form with advanced conditional logic. A specific solution using regular expressions (e.g., `^[A-Z]{2}\\d{5}$`) was implemented for \"Client Code\" input validation. The challenge of native pre-submission preview was addressed by focusing on the achievable conditional logic.

        *   **8.3.3 Automation of Email Reporting and Follow-ups (Task C):**
            *   **Objective:** To automate the internal reporting and follow-up email process, which was previously manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors in tracking pending tasks and distributing summaries.
            *   **Methodology & Tools:** Google Sheets served as the data source. Google Apps Script was the core automation platform, utilizing `MailApp`/`GmailApp` for sending emails and Google Drive API for Excel exporting. HTML and JavaScript (within Apps Script) were used to format email content to mirror spreadsheet styling.
            *   **Outcome & Solutions:** Developed scripts to: a) send a formatted summary table from a Google Sheet via email, retaining visual styles (merged cells, colors, fonts) in an HTML body, and attach the report as an Excel file; b) send personalized reminder emails to employees based on pending tasks listed in a sheet, including a hyperlink to the tracker. Challenges such as permission errors, HTML rendering discrepancies, and API usage were resolved through scope adjustments, custom HTML/CSS construction, and careful API parameterization.
            *   **Impact:** Significantly reduced manual effort, enabled timely reminders improving responsiveness, enhanced professionalism of internal communications, and provided a scalable foundation for further reporting automation.

        *   **8.3.4 Automation of Daily Market Turnover Data Collection and Consolidation (Task D):**
            *   **Objective:** To create an automated, reliable, and centralized system for daily collection and consolidation of market turnover data from multiple external sources (NSE CM, NSE F&O, BSE Equity, BSE F&O) to support critical analyses such as market trends and MIS reporting.
            *   **Methodology & Tools:** Python was the primary tool, using libraries like Pandas, Openpyxl, Requests (for NSE APIs), and Selenium with BeautifulSoup (for BSE website scraping). A master Python script orchestrated individual scrapers, managed date ranges (including re-fetching the last four trading days' data for accuracy), consolidated data into a master Excel sheet (\"Master_data\"), handled deduplication, and sorted the output. Excel Power Query was integrated to transform and present the raw consolidated data in a clean, analyzable format.
            *   **Outcome & Solutions:** Successfully automated the complex data collection process. The system ensures historical completeness and recent data accuracy by re-fetching and overwriting recent entries. This provides a \"single source of truth\" for turnover data. The modular design allows for potential future expansion.
            *   **Impact:** Substantial reduction in manual effort and risk of human error, ensuring timely and accurate data availability for informed decision-making in areas like trading strategy, market surveillance, and regulatory reporting.

    *   \"These diverse automation tasks demonstrated versatility in applying technical skills (SQL, Python, Google Apps Script, Web Scraping) to solve practical business problems, contributing to operational efficiencies and improved data management within various teams at Religare.\"

 A team that teaches, supports, and uplifts — my first month at Religare Broking Ltd.
As part of my Summer Internship Program at SVKM's Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS), I’m currently interning in the Business Excellence Department at Religare Broking Ltd., under the guidance of Jasbir Sir.

This department is the nerve center for data across the organization — but beyond its operational importance, it’s known for something truly exceptional: its people.
Over the past month, I’ve had the privilege of working with a remarkably cohesive team:
Jasbir Singh, Saquib Hayat, Mukhar Goel, vaibhav kirshnatrey, Hoshiyar Gusain, Kartick Sardar, and Deepak Rastogi.
 Despite differences in roles and experience, the team operates as a single unit. There’s no formality or distance — just mutual respect and a genuine commitment to shared goals.
Tasks are picked up intuitively; if someone is busy, others step in — no need for requests or recognition. Even during tight deadlines, the atmosphere remains calm, friendly, and filled with a quiet sense of ownership and support.

What stands out most is their eagerness to learn. Team members often discuss tools like AI, Excel, Access, Power BI, SQL, and Python — not only to sharpen their own skills but to help colleagues across departments. Sometimes, they even ask me, as a student, what’s new or trending in the industry. This two-way exchange of knowledge makes the environment incredibly dynamic and inclusive.

In fact, the team’s approachable nature and reputation make it a regular stop for colleagues from other departments — whether it’s to get help, share ideas, or simply recharge in a space that radiates positivity.
I feel genuinely lucky to have landed in such a space.
 Sitting between Saquib, Deepak, and Vaibhav, I’ve learned more in one month than I could’ve expected. Saquib introduced me to the data infrastructure, while Deepak and Vaibhav have been my go-to problem solvers — always ready to guide with warmth and encouragement. (Also, Vaibhav keeps the whole team smiling!)
The same spirit of support extends across the team — Mukhar, Hoshiyar, and Kartick have each checked in, offered help, or shared tips on working smarter. Their deep experience and open attitude have made a real impact on my learning.
And of course, Jasbir Sir has been a mentor in the truest sense. He first gave me tasks in stats, SQL, and Excel — I now realize those were to gauge my understanding. Since then, he’s entrusted me with meaningful work (more on that in my next post!) and has always been available to explain concepts and encourage thoughtful learning.

        *   **Action for you:** Retrieve this from your modeling notebook's output.

    *   **Annexure D: Detailed Confusion Matrices & Threshold Analysis Data (Optional but Good)**
        *   **Content:**
            *   For both the 90D and 270D best RF models:
                *   The full confusion matrix (TP, FP, FN, TN) at the default 0.5 threshold.
                *   The table of Recall (C1), Precision (C1), F1 (C1), and Accuracy at various thresholds that you generated in Cell 12.
        *   **Action for you:** Copy these tables from your notebook outputs.

    *   **Annexure E: Sample SQL Queries for Initial Data Extraction (Optional)**
        *   **Content:** The 5 SQL queries used to extract data from Oracle into text files.
        *   **Action for you:** Copy these if you have them and feel they are relevant for a technical appendix.

    *   **Annexure F: Details of Minor Automation Tasks (If not fully covered in Section 8.3 and you want to elaborate)**
        *   **Content:** If your descriptions in Section 8.3 were very brief and you want to provide a slightly more expanded version of the \"Objective, Methodology, Outcome\" for Task A, B, C, D, you could do it here.
        *   **Action for you:** Decide if the detail in Section 8.3 is sufficient or if an annexure would add value without making the report too bulky. Given your detailed input for these tasks, keeping them concise in Section 8.3 might be better, and an annexure might be overkill unless there are specific diagrams or code snippets you want to include for them.

*   **Formatting:** Each annexure should be clearly labeled (Annexure A, Annexure B, etc.) and have a descriptive title.

**Your Next Steps for Sections 13 & 14:**

1.  **For References:** Make a list of any citable external sources you directly used.
2.  **For Annexures:**
    *   **Definitely prepare Annexure A (ABT Feature Dictionary).** This is very important for anyone trying to understand your model inputs.
    *   **Prepare Annexure B and C (Full Feature Importances).**
    *   **Consider preparing Annexure D (Threshold Analysis Data).** This supports your discussion on optimal thresholds.
    *   Decide on the inclusion of Annexure E (SQL) and F (Minor Task Details).

Once you have the content for these, you'll primarily be assembling information rather than drafting new prose.

After this, the only major section left to write from scratch would be the **Executive Summary (Section 4)**, which should be done *after* all other content sections (9-14) are complete. You also have sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 to finalize with your personal/organizational details."""),

**Points to Check/Refine for Section 13:**

*   **Publication Dates for Web Articles:** For links 2, 3, and C, try to find a specific publication date on the webpage itself. If available, it makes the citation more precise (e.g., \"Dalal Street Investment Journal. (2023, December 5). ...\"). If not, \"n.d.\" (no date) is acceptable for web content, but less ideal.
*   **Academic Paper Details (B):** For the \"Mutanen, T., Nousiainen, S., & Ahola, J.\" paper, the ResearchGate link is a good start. If you can open the paper itself from there, look for:
    *   The year it was published.
    *   Where it was published (e.g., a specific conference name like \"Proceedings of the Xth International Conference on Y\" or a journal name). This adds to the citation's completeness. If it's just a preprint or working paper on ResearchGate without formal publication elsewhere, then citing it via ResearchGate is okay.
*   **Link for Paper A:** The link `chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40854-023-00558-3.pdf` suggests it's being opened via a PDF viewer extension. The actual direct link would be just `https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40854-023-00558-3.pdf` or even better, the article's landing page on Springer: `https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-023-00558-3`. Using the direct link to the article page is usually preferred.

This provides a solid draft for your References section. You just need to verify/find any missing dates for the web articles and potentially refine the publication details for the academic paper from ResearchGate.

Now, for **Section 14: Annexures**, we have already discussed the potential content:
*   **Annexure A: Detailed ABT Feature Dictionary (Highly Recommended)**
*   **Annexure B: Full Feature Importance Details - 270-Day Churn Model (Recommended)**
*   **Annexure C: Full Feature Importance Details - 90-Day Churn Model (Recommended)**
*   **Annexure D: Detailed Confusion Matrices & Threshold Analysis Data (Good to have)**
*   **Annexure E: Sample SQL Queries (Optional)**
*   **Annexure F: Further Details of Minor Automation Tasks (Optional, only if Section 8.3 wasn't detailed enough)**

You will need to compile the content for these annexures from your notebooks and records. For example, for Annexure A, you'll list each feature name from your final ABT and write a brief description.

With this, the planning for all sections of your report is complete! The main task remaining is the drafting of the prose for each section and compiling the annexures, followed by writing the Executive Summary last."""),

You've provided the five key queries used to pull the raw data from the Oracle database sources into the text files that were then consumed by PySpark.

Here's how you can present it in your report:

**Annexure E: SQL Queries for Raw Data Extraction**

\"The following SQL queries were used to extract the initial datasets from Religare's Oracle database systems. The output of these queries was saved into delimited text files, which then served as the input for the PySpark-based ABT generation process.\"

**E.1 Query 1: Extract Base Client Details**
*   **Source Table:** `biuser.tblclientdetail`
*   **Purpose:** To retrieve fundamental client information including activation date and overall last activity markers.
```sql
SELECT
    CLIENTCODE,
    TRUNC(ACTIVATIONDATE) AS ACTIVATIONDATE,
    TRUNC(LASTLEDGERCREDITDATE) AS Overall_Last_Ledger_Credit_Date,
    LASTLEDGERCREDITAMOUNT,
    TRUNC(LASTTRADEDATE) AS Overall_Last_Trade_Date
FROM
    biuser.tblclientdetail;
```

**E.2 Query 2: Extract Raw Trade Data**
*   **Source Table:** `biuser.tblfactbrokcube`
*   **Purpose:** To gather records of client trading activity and associated gross brokerage.
```sql
SELECT
    CLIENTCODE,
    TRUNC(IMPORTDATE) AS Trade_Date,
    GROSSBROK AS TOTAL_GROSS_BROKERAGE_DAY -- Aliased to match expected txt file header
FROM
    biuser.tblfactbrokcube
WHERE
    IMPORTDATE IS NOT NULL;
```
*(Self-correction: I've aliased `GROSSBROK` to `TOTAL_GROSS_BROKERAGE_DAY` here to match the column name you provided earlier for `trade_data.txt`. Similarly, `Trade_Date` matches your prior file structure for `trade_data.txt`.)*

**E.3 Query 3: Extract Raw Payout Data**
*   **Source Table:** `BIUSER.LD_VWPAYOUTREQUEST`
*   **Purpose:** To obtain records of processed and approved client payout requests.
```sql
SELECT

**Key Points for This Annexure:**

*   **Clarity:** Each query is presented with its source table and a brief purpose.
*   **Formatting:** SQL code is formatted for readability.
*   **Aliasing Consistency (Self-corrections made):** I've updated the aliases in the SELECT clauses of Queries 2, 3, and 4 (e.g., `GROSSBROK AS TOTAL_GROSS_BROKERAGE_DAY`, `TRUNC(DAPPROVEDDATE) AS PAYOUT_DATE`) to ensure the output column names from these SQL queries would directly match the headers you previously confirmed for the respective `.txt` files (`trade_data.txt`, `payout_data.txt`, `deposit_data.txt`). This makes the transition from SQL output to text file input for PySpark seamless.
*   **Dormancy Data Caveat:** It's important to keep the note that Query 5 (Dormancy Data) was for initial analysis and not for the predictive model's target definition, as this was a key strategic decision in the project.

**4. Executive Summary**

This report details a major internship project undertaken at Religare Broking Ltd. focused on developing a predictive modeling framework to proactively identify customers at risk of churn. In the competitive stockbroking industry, customer retention is paramount due to high acquisition costs and the value of sustained client engagement. The primary challenge addressed was Religare's need for a systematic, data-driven approach to forecast churn, enabling more effective and timely retention interventions.

The core objective of this project was to leverage historical client data—encompassing client details, comprehensive trading activity, platform logins, funding transactions (deposits and payouts), AUM, and cash balances—to build machine learning models capable of predicting churn within 90-day and 270-day future windows. Churn was specifically defined as the cessation of *both* trading and login activities after a period of recent engagement.

A robust Analytical Base Table (ABT) was constructed using PySpark, involving snapshots of client data from January 2021 to April 2023. This process included extensive feature engineering to create approximately 78 predictive features capturing client tenure, recency, frequency, and monetary aspects of their various interactions, alongside trend-indicating delta features. Exploratory Data Analysis revealed critical insights, including the high frequency of typical trading, a significant \"infant mortality\" pattern where most long-term inactivity begins at activation, and the dominance of combined trade/login cessation as the primary churn pathway.

Machine learning models, primarily Logistic Regression (as a baseline) and Random Forest, were developed and evaluated. Class imbalance in the churn labels was addressed for Logistic Regression using class weighting. For Random Forest, hyperparameter tuning was performed using `TrainValidationSplit` on a data sample, optimizing for Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR).

**Key Findings & Model Performance (Best Tuned Random Forest Models):**

*   **270-Day Churn Model:** Achieved an excellent **AUC-ROC of 0.989** and a strong **AUC-PR of 0.723**. At the default 0.5 threshold, this model identified **71.1% of actual 270-day churners (Recall)** with **63.85% precision** (correctly identifying churners when a churn prediction is made).
    *   Key drivers included longer-term login and trade frequency/recency (e.g., `Login_Txns_Count_270D`, `Days_Since_Last_Login`).
*   **90-Day Churn Model:** Achieved an **AUC-ROC of 0.991** and an **AUC-PR of 0.608**. At the default 0.5 threshold, this model identified **45.1% of actual 90-day churners (Recall)** with **63.6% precision**.
    *   Threshold analysis for this model indicated that adjusting the prediction threshold to 0.4 could improve **recall for 90-day churners to ~63.3%** with a precision of ~56.7%, optimizing the F1-score for this early-warning scenario.
    *   Key drivers were more focused on *recent* login and trade activity (e.g., `Login_Txns_Count_90D`, `Days_Since_Last_Login`).

The differing feature importances underscore that distinct behavioral patterns may precede short-term versus longer-term disengagement. Login activity consistently emerged as a top predictor across both models.

**Potential Business Impact & Recommendations:**

The developed models offer Religare a significant opportunity to transition to proactive, data-driven customer retention. Potential impacts include improved retention rates (illustratively, retaining even 10% of correctly identified at-risk 270-day churners could preserve substantial annual revenue, based on industry benchmarks), optimized allocation of retention budgets by focusing on high-risk/high-value segments, and enhanced customer understanding.

It is recommended that Religare:
1.  Consider utilizing both the 90-day model (potentially with an adjusted threshold for higher recall) as an early warning system for timely, broad-reach interventions, and the 270-day model for identifying more deeply disengaged clients requiring different retention strategies.
2.  Act on the feature insights to develop strategies that encourage consistent platform engagement, particularly login activity.
3.  Initiate a pilot program to operationalize one of the models, applying predictions to a client segment and measuring the impact of interventions via A/B testing.
4.  Plan for future iterations, including incorporating additional data sources (e.g., payout risk features already in ABT, customer service interactions), dedicated tuning for all target windows, and establishing a model monitoring and retraining schedule.

This project successfully demonstrates the feasibility and value of applying machine learning to predict customer churn at Religare, providing a strong foundation for enhancing customer loyalty and business profitability. Further contributions during the internship included the automation of client segmentation for MTF marketing, design of dynamic Google Forms, automation of email reporting, and development of a system for daily market turnover data collection, showcasing a broad application of analytical and automation skills.

Here are a few minor observations and potential areas for slight refinement, but these are more about polishing than fundamental changes:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Problem & Objective:** The \"Why\" and \"What\" of the project are immediately clear.
*   **Good Methodology Overview:** It touches upon the key technical steps without getting bogged down in excessive detail.
*   **Quantified Key Results:** Presenting the AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, Recall, and Precision for both models is excellent. This gives concrete evidence of success.
*   **Highlights Different Insights for Different Windows:** The distinction between drivers for 90D vs. 270D churn is well made.
*   **Actionable Recommendations:** The recommendations are practical and business-oriented.
*   **Balanced:** It covers the problem, solution, results, and future implications.
*   **Acknowledgement of Other Work:** The final sentence neatly incorporates your other contributions.

**Potential Minor Refinements (Consider these as suggestions, not necessarily mandatory changes):**

1.  **Opening Sentence Impact:**
    *   *Current:* \"This report details a major internship project undertaken at Religare Broking Ltd. focused on developing a predictive modeling framework to proactively identify customers at risk of churn.\"
    *   *Slightly More Impactful (Optional):* \"In the highly competitive stockbroking industry, effective customer retention is critical for sustained profitability. This report details a major internship project at Religare Broking Ltd. that successfully developed a predictive modeling framework to proactively identify customers at risk of churn, enabling more targeted and efficient retention strategies.\" (This just brings the \"why it matters\" even more upfront).

2.  **Clarity on \"Tuned\" for 90D Model:**
    *   When mentioning the 90D model's performance, you stated in our discussion (and it's good practice) that it used hyperparameters derived from the 270D tuning. The Executive Summary currently just says \"Tuned Random Forest Models\" for both. This is fine for brevity. If you wanted extreme precision *within the summary*, you could add a micro-note, but it might make it too wordy. The current level is likely acceptable. The main report (Section 10.5.2) clarifies this.

3.  **Specificity of \"Substantial Annual Revenue\":**
    *   *Current:* \"...retaining even 10% of correctly identified at-risk 270-day churners could preserve substantial annual revenue, based on industry benchmarks.\"
    *   *Slightly More Specific (If you feel comfortable including the illustrative number from Section 11):* \"...retaining even 10% of correctly identified at-risk 270-day churners could preserve approximately **₹84.7 lakhs in potential annual revenue** (based on conservative industry benchmarks for client value), underscoring the financial benefits.\"
    *   This makes the \"substantial\" more concrete.

4.  **Flow of Recommendations:** The recommendations are good. Just ensure they flow logically from most immediate/impactful. The current order (Utilize models -> Act on features -> Pilot -> Future iterations) is logical.

5.  **Consistency of \"Churners (Class 1)\":**
    *   In the \"Key Findings\" section, you list metrics for \"Churners (Class 1)\". This is clear. Ensure this terminology is used if you present similar breakdowns elsewhere or if it's common in your discussions.

**Overall Assessment:**

The current draft is **excellent** and hits an A/A- grade for an executive summary. The suggestions above are very minor and aimed at taking it to an A+. The existing version is already fit for purpose.

**No major changes are *needed* unless you feel one of the minor refinements significantly enhances clarity or impact for your specific audience.** The most impactful small addition might be the quantified revenue example if you're comfortable including it directly in the summary.

Religare Broking Ltd. (RBL) stands as one of India's leading full-service retail broking houses, offering a comprehensive suite of financial services spanning across equity trading, derivatives, commodities, depository services, mutual funds, insurance distribution, and innovative e-governance solutions. Established in 1984 and operating for over 25 years in the broking business, the company has evolved from a traditional stock brokerage firm into a diversified financial services provider with a robust market presence across 400+ cities in India, serving over 1 million clients through its extensive network of 69 branches and 1,400+ touch points.

## Company Overview and Historical Foundation

Religare Broking Ltd. operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Religare Enterprises Limited (REL), positioning itself within one of India's leading diversified financial services groups[2]. The company's journey began in 1984 when it was initially established as Religare Securities Ltd (RSL), marking its entry into India's emerging capital markets landscape[3]. This foundational period established the groundwork for what would become a significant player in the Indian financial services sector.

The company achieved several critical milestones in its early development phase. In 1994, Religare secured its listing on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), demonstrating its commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance[3]. The strategic expansion continued in 2000 when the company obtained membership for the Futures and Options segments of the NSE, broadening its service capabilities to include derivatives trading[3]. Additionally, the company registered with the National Security Depository Limited (NSDL) as a depository participant, further enhancing its service portfolio[3].

The early 2000s marked a period of significant diversification for the Religare group. In 2001, Religare Finvest Ltd. was established as a private Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) under the Religare brand, expanding the group's financial services capabilities[3]. The company's commitment to comprehensive market participation was further demonstrated in 2004 when it received designation as a stock broker at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and when Religare Commodities Ltd. began operations as a trading-cum-clearing member at both the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) and Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX)[3].

## Comprehensive Service Portfolio

Religare Broking Ltd. has developed an extensive range of financial products and services designed to meet the diverse needs of retail investors, high-net-worth individuals, and institutional clients. The company's core broking services encompass the full spectrum of market segments, including equity trading, derivatives trading, commodities trading, and currency trading[5]. These fundamental services form the backbone of the company's revenue generation and client engagement strategy.

Beyond traditional broking services, RBL has expanded into depository participant services, providing clients with secure and efficient securities holding and transfer capabilities[5]. The company also serves as a distributor for bonds and mutual funds, offering clients access to a broad range of investment options beyond direct equity markets[5]. This diversification strategy enables clients to build comprehensive investment portfolios through a single service provider.

The company's role as an IRDA registered Corporate Agent allows it to distribute insurance policies, adding a crucial risk management component to its service offerings[5]. Additionally, RBL provides research capabilities to its customers, offering analytical insights and market intelligence that support informed investment decision-making[5]. The company is also registered with the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and SEBI to act as Point of Presence (PoP) for the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and as Registrars to an issue and share Transfer Agent (RTA) respectively[5].

### Digital and E-Governance Services

Religare has strategically positioned itself in the rapidly growing e-governance sector through its Religare Digital vertical. The company offers an extensive range of citizen e-services and financial inclusion services, including permanent account number (PAN) applications, tax deduction and collection account number (TAN) services, and e-TDS returns processing[5]. These services address critical administrative needs for both individual and business clients.

The company operates as a business correspondent for banking services and provides Bharat Bill Payment Systems (BBPS) services along with mobile and utility recharges[5]. Additionally, RBL offers ticketing services for airlines, railways, buses, and tourism through both online and offline platforms[5]. The company also provides Digital Signature Certificate and Token (DSC) services and operates Central Record Keeping Agency Facilitation Centre (CRA-FC)[5].

## Market Presence and Operational Scale

Religare Broking Ltd. has established a formidable market presence across India, serving over 1 million broking clients through a sophisticated distribution network[5]. The company's client base includes approximately 2.5 lakh active clients, demonstrating strong engagement levels and regular trading activity[5]. This substantial client base positions RBL as one of the leading players in India's retail broking segment.

The company's distribution strategy combines owned infrastructure with franchise partnerships to maximize market reach and operational efficiency. RBL operates through a network of 69 company-owned branches strategically located across India, providing direct customer service and support[5]. This infrastructure is complemented by approximately 1,400 broking business partners who extend the company's reach into local markets and specialized client segments[5].

The e-governance business has shown particularly impressive growth, with the network expanding from 27,000 franchisees in FY23 to 44,000 franchisees in FY24, representing a significant 63% year-over-year increase[5]. The current network encompasses approximately 51,000 e-governance franchisees operating across 400+ cities in India[5]. This extensive distribution network enables RBL to serve clients in both urban centers and semi-urban/rural markets, supporting financial inclusion objectives.

### Financial Performance and Market Metrics

The company has demonstrated strong operational momentum, with average daily turnover (ADTO) increasing by 76% to ₹16,000 crore in FY24, showing consistent year-on-year growth trends[5]. Total income increased substantially from ₹287.90 crore in FY23 to ₹369.01 crore in FY24, representing a 28% growth rate[5]. Profit after tax (PAT) showed even more impressive growth, increasing from ₹9.61 crore in FY23 to ₹33.34 crore in FY24, demonstrating improved operational efficiency and market conditions[5].

Recent developments have positioned the company for potential further growth. The Burman group entities have been classified as promoters of Religare Enterprises Limited with a 25.16% shareholding, following a strategic acquisition process[5]. This development is expected to provide RBL with better financial flexibility, access to competitive cost of funding, and need-based capital support[5].

## Mission, Vision, and Core Values

Religare's organizational mission centers on empowering individuals and businesses to achieve their financial goals through innovative and reliable financial services[4]. The company strives to function as a trusted partner for clients, providing tailored solutions that meet unique needs and aspirations[4]. This mission statement reflects the company's commitment to client-centric service delivery and customized financial solutions.

The company's vision encompasses fostering a culture of integrity, innovation, and inclusivity while setting new benchmarks in the industry through a relentless pursuit of excellence[4]. This vision statement emphasizes the company's commitment to ethical business practices, technological advancement, and inclusive service delivery that benefits diverse client segments[4].

Religare's core values emphasize customer-centricity and ethical business practices, building a reputation for reliability and trustworthiness[4]. The company's commitment to serving customers with integrity and transparency distinguishes it from competitors in the highly competitive financial services market[4]. These values guide decision-making processes and operational strategies across all business verticals.

## Unique Selling Propositions and Competitive Differentiators

Religare Broking Ltd. distinguishes itself in the competitive Indian broking landscape through several key differentiators. The company's comprehensive service portfolio, spanning traditional broking services and innovative e-governance solutions, provides clients with a unique one-stop financial services platform. This integrated approach reduces client friction and increases engagement by addressing multiple financial and administrative needs through a single provider relationship.

The company's extensive physical and digital distribution network represents another significant competitive advantage. The combination of owned branches, franchise partners, and digital platforms enables RBL to serve diverse client segments across urban, semi-urban, and rural markets. This multi-channel approach supports both high-touch service delivery for complex client needs and efficient digital service delivery for routine transactions.

Religare's commitment to financial inclusion through its e-governance vertical represents a unique positioning in the market. By facilitating government services and citizen e-services, the company addresses fundamental administrative needs while building deeper community relationships. This approach supports long-term client retention and creates multiple touchpoints for cross-selling financial services.

## Strategic Relevance to Customer Retention

In the highly competitive Indian broking industry, customer churn prediction and retention strategies are strategically critical for Religare Broking Ltd.'s continued growth and market leadership. The company's diverse client base of over 1 million broking clients represents a substantial revenue-generating asset that requires careful nurturing and retention management. Given the relatively low switching costs in the broking industry and increasing competition from both traditional full-service brokers and emerging discount brokers, maintaining client loyalty becomes paramount to sustained profitability.

The company's multi-service platform creates opportunities for enhanced client stickiness through cross-selling and bundled service offerings. However, this complexity also creates potential friction points where clients might experience dissatisfaction leading to churn. Understanding client behavior patterns, service utilization trends, and early warning indicators of potential churn enables RBL to implement proactive retention strategies and maintain its competitive market position. For a company generating ₹369.01 crore in annual revenue with over 2.5 lakh active clients, even modest improvements in retention rates can translate to significant revenue preservation and growth opportunities.

It's much more than I would typically expect an intern to compile for this section, which is fantastic.

Given your guideline to **\"take necessary parts only\"** and keep the report concise, especially for a section like \"About the Organization\" which provides context rather than being a core results chapter, we need to distill this into a more focused narrative.

Here's a draft for **Section 7: About the Organization (Religare Broking Ltd.)**, aiming to be informative yet concise, drawing from your detailed input:

**7. About the Organization: Religare Broking Ltd.**

Religare Broking Ltd. (RBL) is a prominent full-service retail broking house in India, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Religare Enterprises Limited (REL), a diversified Indian financial services group. With a legacy in the broking business spanning over two decades (operations evolving from Religare Securities Ltd., established earlier), RBL has grown into a significant financial services provider. The company offers a comprehensive suite of services including equity trading, derivatives, commodities, depository services, mutual fund and bond distribution, insurance, and e-governance solutions.

RBL serves a substantial client base, reported to be over 1 million broking clients with approximately 2.5 lakh active clients, through an extensive distribution network. This network combines company-owned branches (around 69) with a large number of broking business partners (over 1,400) and an expanding e-governance franchisee network (approximately 51,000) across more than 400 cities in India. This multi-channel approach enables RBL to cater to diverse client segments across urban, semi-urban, and rural markets.

The company's service portfolio extends beyond traditional broking to include research capabilities for clients and a significant digital presence through its \"Religare Digital\" vertical, offering a wide array of citizen e-services (PAN, TAN applications, e-TDS returns) and financial inclusion services (banking correspondent services, bill payments, ticketing). RBL is registered with key regulatory bodies including NSE, BSE (for various segments including cash and F&O), NSDL as a depository participant, IRDA as a corporate agent for insurance, and PFRDA/SEBI for NPS and RTA services respectively.

Recent financial performance (FY24) indicated strong growth in average daily turnover (ADTO), total income (₹369.01 crore, a 28% increase YoY), and profit after tax (₹33.34 crore, a significant increase YoY). Strategic developments, such as the Burman group entities being classified as promoters of the parent company Religare Enterprises Limited, are anticipated to enhance RBL's financial flexibility and capital support.

Religare's mission focuses on empowering clients to achieve their financial goals through reliable and innovative services, guided by core values of customer-centricity and ethical practices. For an organization of RBL's scale and diverse service offerings, particularly in the competitive Indian broking market, understanding client behavior and proactively managing customer retention is strategically vital for sustained growth, revenue preservation, and market leadership. This churn prediction project directly addresses this imperative.

**Key Decisions for Conciseness in this Draft:**

*   **Focus on RBL:** While the history of REL is interesting, the focus here is kept primarily on Religare Broking Ltd. (RBL) as the direct entity for the project.
*   **Consolidated History:** The detailed year-by-year milestones are summarized into a narrative of evolution and key capabilities achieved (e.g., NSE/BSE memberships, DP status).
*   **Service Portfolio Summary:** Key service categories are mentioned rather than an exhaustive list of every sub-service.
*   **Market Presence Summary:** Focuses on the scale (clients, cities, touchpoints) rather than the year-over-year franchisee growth percentage.
*   **Financials:** High-level FY24 growth figures are included as they are impactful, but detailed financial tables are avoided. The Burman group development is mentioned for its strategic significance.
*   **Mission/Vision/Values:** Summarized into a single paragraph focusing on client empowerment and ethical practices.
*   **USPs:** Woven into the description of services and market presence (e.g., comprehensive portfolio, extensive network, e-governance).
*   **Strategic Relevance:** Briefly reiterated at the end to tie back to the project.

**What this draft achieves:**

*   Provides a good overview of RBL's business, scale, and market position.
*   Highlights its key service areas.
*   Gives a sense of its operational strength and recent performance.
*   Connects the organization's nature to the importance of the churn project.
*   It's about 1 to 1.5 pages, which is a reasonable length for this section in a larger project report.

Here's how you typically create and include them:

**1. How to Create and Include the Table of Contents (TOC) - Section 5**

*   **Method:** The best way to create a TOC is to use the **built-in features of your word processing software** (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LaTeX). These tools can automatically generate a TOC based on the heading styles you use in your document.
*   **Steps (General):**
    1.  **Apply Heading Styles Consistently:** As you write or finalize your report, make sure you use consistent heading styles for your main sections and sub-sections.
        *   Example:
            *   Section 9: Introduction (Heading 1 Style)
            *   9.1 Background... (Heading 2 Style)
            *   9.2 The Challenge... (Heading 2 Style)
            *   Section 10: Solution Design... (Heading 1 Style)
            *   10.1 Data Understanding... (Heading 2 Style)
            *   10.2.1 Initial Data Extraction... (Heading 3 Style)
    2.  **Insert Automatic TOC:**
        *   **Microsoft Word:** Go to the \"References\" tab, click \"Table of Contents,\" and choose an automatic style.
        *   **Google Docs:** Go to \"Insert\" -> \"Table of contents\" and choose a style (with page numbers or with links).
        *   **LaTeX:** Uses commands like `\\tableofcontents`. You'll need to compile your document a couple of times for page numbers to be correct.
    3.  **Placement:** The TOC usually comes after the Executive Summary and before the main body of the report (e.g., before your Section 7 \"About the Organization\" or Section 9 \"Introduction,\" depending on your exact report flow).
    4.  **Update TOC:** If you make changes to headings or pagination after inserting the TOC, remember to **update it**. Most word processors have an \"Update Table\" or \"Update field\" option (often by right-clicking the TOC).

*   **What it will look like (Example):**
    ```
    Table of Contents
    1. Title Page ............................................ i
    2. Preface ............................................... ii
    3. Acknowledgements ...................................... iii
    4. Executive Summary ..................................... iv
    5. Table of Contents ..................................... v  <-- (itself)
    6. List of Tables, Graphs & Figures ...................... vi

          ...
    9. Introduction .......................................... 7
       ...
    ```

**2. How to Create and Include the List of Tables, Graphs & Figures - Section 6**

*   **Method:** Similar to the TOC, many word processors can help you generate these lists if you use their \"Caption\" feature for your tables and figures.
*   **Steps (General):**
    1.  **Add Captions to All Tables and Figures:**
        *   For every table, graph, or figure in your report, add a descriptive caption *using your word processor's captioning tool*.
        *   **Microsoft Word:** Right-click the object (or go to \"References\" tab) -> \"Insert Caption...\" -> Select \"Table\" or \"Figure\" label, type your caption (e.g., \"Figure 10.5.1: Feature Importances for 270-Day Churn Model\"). Word will automatically number them.
        *   **Google Docs:** You might have to do this more manually by creating a consistent text style for captions and numbering them yourself, or use an add-on. Alternatively, you can create the list manually.
        *   **LaTeX:** Uses `\\caption{}` within `figure` or `table` environments.
    2.  **Insert List of Tables/Figures:**
        *   **Microsoft Word:** Go to the \"References\" tab -> \"Insert Table of Figures...\" -> Choose \"Table\" from the \"Caption label\" dropdown to generate the List of Tables. Repeat and choose \"Figure\" for the List of Figures.
        *   **Google Docs:** If captions were manual, you'll create this list manually by copying your caption text and adding page numbers.
        *   **LaTeX:** Uses commands like `\\listoftables` and `\\listoffigures`.
    3.  **Placement:** This section usually comes right after the Table of Contents and before the main body. You might have separate lists (List of Tables, List of Figures) or a combined one.
    4.  **Update Lists:** If you add/remove/reorder tables/figures, remember to update these lists.

*   **What it will look like (Example):**

    **List of Tables**
    Table 10.1.1: Primary Data Sources .................................................. X
    Table 10.5.1: Model Performance Comparison (Default Threshold 0.5) .................. Y
    ...

    **List of Figures**
    Figure 10.5.1: Top 20 Feature Importances - Tuned RF for Is\\_Churned\\_Engage\\_270Days ..... Z
    Figure 10.5.2: Precision, Recall, F1 for Churners vs. Threshold - 270Days ............ W
    ...

**Key Recommendations:**

*   **Do this Towards the End:** It's best to generate the TOC and List of Tables/Figures when the main content of your report is largely finalized and page numbers are stable. You'll likely need to update them a few times as you make final edits.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Use consistent heading styles and captioning for automation to work best.
*   **Manual Creation as a Fallback:** If your word processor's automatic features are problematic or you prefer more control, you can always create these lists manually. It's more work but ensures accuracy.

By using these features, your report will be much more professional and easier for your distinguished audience to navigate."""),

**Breakdown of the 270-Day Churn Model Summary:**

*   **`270-Day Churn Model: Achieved an excellent AUC-ROC of 0.989 and a strong AUC-PR of 0.723.`**
    *   **AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) = 0.989:**
        *   This measures the model's ability to distinguish between clients who will churn (in 270 days) and those who will not.
        *   A score of 0.5 is random guessing, and 1.0 is perfect discrimination.
        *   **0.989 is extremely high, indicating your model is excellent at telling these two groups apart across all possible probability thresholds.** It's very confident in its ranking of clients by churn risk.
    *   **AUC-PR (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve) = 0.723:**
        *   This metric is particularly useful when you have class imbalance (many more non-churners than churners).
        *   It summarizes the trade-off between Precision (how many flagged as churners actually churn) and Recall (how many actual churners are caught) for the *churner class*.
        *   The baseline for AUC-PR is the proportion of the positive class (churners). If, say, 5% of clients churn in 270 days, an AUC-PR of 0.05 would be random.
        *   **0.723 is a very strong AUC-PR.** It means your model maintains good precision even as it tries to achieve higher recall for the churner class, significantly outperforming a random model.

*   **`At the default 0.5 threshold, this model identified 71.1% of actual 270-day churners (Recall) with 63.85% precision (correctly identifying churners when a churn prediction is made).`**
    *   This explains the model's performance when you use the standard 0.5 probability cutoff (if P(churn) > 0.5, predict churn).
    *   **Recall (Sensitivity) = 71.1%:** Of all the clients who *actually did churn* within 270 days, your model correctly identified 71.1% of them. This is good – you're catching a large majority of the true churners.
    *   **Precision = 63.85%:** When your model *predicts* that a client will churn in 270 days, that prediction is correct 63.85% of the time. The other ~36% are False Positives (clients predicted to churn who didn't). This precision is quite good; nearly two-thirds of your \"churn alerts\" are accurate.

*   **`Key drivers included longer-term login and trade frequency/recency (e.g., Login_Txns_Count_270D, Days_Since_Last_Login).`**
    *   This summarizes the feature importance findings for this specific model. It tells the audience that sustained engagement over many months (like login transaction counts over 270 days) and how recently a client last logged in are strong signals for predicting longer-term (270-day) churn.

---

**Breakdown of the 90-Day Churn Model Summary:**

*   **`90-Day Churn Model: Achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.991 and an AUC-PR of 0.608.`**
    *   **AUC-ROC = 0.991:** Even slightly higher than the 270D model, indicating exceptional ability to distinguish between 90-day churners and non-churners.
    *   **AUC-PR = 0.608:** Still a very good AUC-PR, significantly above random. It's a bit lower than the 270D model's AUC-PR (0.723), which suggests that achieving high precision *while also getting high recall* for the 90-day churners might be inherently a bit more challenging, or that the specific parameters used (borrowed from 270D tuning) weren't as optimal for the 90D target's PR curve.

*   **`At the default 0.5 threshold, this model identified 45.1% of actual 90-day churners (Recall) with 63.6% precision.`**
    *   **Recall = 45.1%:** At the default cutoff, this model only catches less than half of the clients who will actually churn in the next 90 days. This is much lower than the 270D model's recall.
    *   **Precision = 63.6%:** Similar to the 270D model, when it predicts 90-day churn, it's correct about 63.6% of the time.

*   **`Threshold analysis for this model indicated that adjusting the prediction threshold to 0.4 could improve recall for 90-day churners to ~63.3% with a precision of ~56.7%, optimizing the F1-score for this early-warning scenario.`**
    *   This is a key actionable insight. You're showing that the default 0.5 threshold isn't the best for this 90-day model if the goal is to catch more churners.
    *   By lowering the threshold to 0.4 (meaning you flag clients as churners even if their churn probability is just > 0.4):
        *   Recall jumps to ~63.3% (now catching almost two-thirds of actual 90-day churners).
        *   Precision drops to ~56.7% (more false alarms, but still more than half your flags are correct).
        *   This new balance (at threshold 0.4) results in a better F1-score (which balances precision and recall) for the churner class, making it potentially more useful as an \"early warning\" where higher recall is often desired.

*   **`Key drivers were more focused on recent login and trade activity (e.g., Login_Txns_Count_90D, Days_Since_Last_Login).`**
    *   This highlights the difference from the 270D model. For predicting shorter-term (90-day) churn, the model relies more heavily on *very recent* patterns of engagement.

---

**Concluding Insights:**

*   **`The differing feature importances underscore that distinct behavioral patterns may precede short-term versus longer-term disengagement.`**
    *   This is a valuable strategic insight. It tells Religare that they can't use a one-size-fits-all view of churn drivers. What predicts near-term churn is different from what predicts longer-term churn.

*   **`Login activity consistently emerged as a top predictor across both models.`**
    *   This emphasizes a critical, perhaps sometimes overlooked, engagement metric. It's not just about trading; simply logging into the platform is a strong sign of continued interest or intent.

---

**In essence, this part of your Executive Summary tells a story:**

1.  We built two strong models (for 90D and 270D churn).
2.  Both are good at distinguishing churners from non-churners generally (high AUC-ROC).
3.  The 270D model is naturally better at balancing precision and recall for its longer-term target (higher AUC-PR).
4.  At the default 0.5 threshold:
    *   The 270D model catches a lot of its target churners (71% recall) with good precision (64%).
    *   The 90D model, while precise (64%), misses many of its target churners (45% recall).
5.  **BUT, we can make the 90D model much more effective as an early warning by adjusting its threshold** (e.g., to 0.4, boosting recall to ~63%).
6.  The factors driving churn are different for short vs. long term, but login activity is consistently vital.

Focusing retention efforts on high-value clients who are also at high risk of churn is a common and very effective business strategy. Your models provide the \"high risk\" part, and Religare likely has ways to identify \"high-value\" clients (e.g., based on past brokerage, AUM, trading frequency).

Here's how you can weave this into the **Executive Summary**, specifically in the \"Potential Business Impact & Recommendations\" part:

**Current Executive Summary - Recommendations part (for context):**
\"...
It is recommended that Religare:
1.  Consider utilizing both the 90-day model (potentially with an adjusted threshold for higher recall) as an early warning system for timely, broad-reach interventions, and the 270-day model for identifying more deeply disengaged clients requiring different retention strategies.
2.  Act on the feature insights to develop strategies that encourage consistent platform engagement, particularly login activity.
3.  Initiate a pilot program to operationalize one of the models, applying predictions to a client segment and measuring the impact of interventions via A/B testing.
4.  Plan for future iterations, including incorporating additional data sources (e.g., payout risk features already in ABT, customer service interactions), dedicated tuning for all target windows, and establishing a model monitoring and retraining schedule.
...\"

**Suggested Addition/Modification to Executive Summary Recommendations:**

You can modify recommendation #1 or add a new point. Let's try modifying #1 for conciseness:

\"...
It is recommended that Religare:
1.  Consider utilizing both the 90-day model (potentially with an adjusted threshold for higher recall) as an early warning system and the 270-day model for identifying more deeply disengaged clients. **Crucially, these churn predictions should be combined with client value segmentation (e.g., based on historical brokerage or AUM) to prioritize retention efforts on high-value, high-risk clients, thereby maximizing the ROI of intervention strategies.**
2.  Act on the feature insights to develop strategies that encourage consistent platform engagement, particularly login activity.
3.  Initiate a pilot program to operationalize one of the models, applying predictions to a client segment and measuring the impact of interventions via A/B testing.
4.  Plan for future iterations, including incorporating additional data sources (e.g., the `Payout_Risk_Flag` and `Historical_Tag` already engineered in the ABT, customer service interactions), dedicated tuning for all target windows, and establishing a model monitoring and retraining schedule.
...\"

**Why this addition is good:**

*   **Directly Addresses Business Strategy:** It connects the predictive model output to a common and effective business strategy (value-based segmentation for retention).
*   **Highlights ROI:** It explicitly mentions maximizing ROI, which resonates well with a business audience.
*   **Actionable:** It gives a clear direction on *how* to make the churn scores even more actionable.
*   **Leverages Existing Data:** Religare likely already has or can easily generate client value segments. Your classification work (the `Historical_Tag`) is a step in this direction, even if you didn't use it as a model *feature* yet. The recommendation also subtly points to using features like `Payout_Risk_Flag` and `Historical_Tag` (which is derived from the Excel classification logic) in *future model iterations* or for *segmentation alongside churn score*.

**Where to Elaborate Further in the Main Report:**

*   **Section 10.5 (Model Results & Discussion) or Section 11 (Impact):**
    *   You can have a sub-point here: \"Strategic Application of Churn Scores with Client Value.\"
    *   Explain the concept of a 2x2 matrix:
        *   High Value / High Churn Risk: **Priority 1 for Retention**
        *   High Value / Low Churn Risk: Monitor, nurture, upsell.
        *   Low Value / High Churn Risk: Consider low-cost automated retention, or accept churn if intervention cost is too high.
        *   Low Value / Low Churn Risk: Standard service.
    *   You can mention that the `Historical_Tag` feature engineered in the ABT (though not used as a model input yet) provides one way to segment clients by a value/engagement proxy and could be used in conjunction with the churn scores.
    *   Mention that features like `AUM_SnapshotMonth_RunningTotal` or `Trade_Sum_365D` (which were important) already give some indication of client value, but a more explicit segmentation would be powerful.

By adding this point to the Executive Summary and elaborating in the main body, you significantly enhance the strategic relevance and practical application of your churn models. It shows you're thinking beyond just the model's statistical performance to its real-world business utility."""),

**Drafting the Sub-Point: \"Strategic Application: Prioritizing Retention with Churn Scores and Client Value\"**

*(This would go into Section 11 of your report)*

\"Beyond the standalone predictive power of the churn models, their strategic value is significantly amplified when combined with client value segmentation. This enables Religare to prioritize retention efforts effectively, focusing resources where they can yield the highest return on investment (ROI). A common and effective framework for this is a 2x2 matrix segmenting clients based on their predicted churn risk and their value to the business:

|                       | **High Churn Risk (Model Prediction)** | **Low Churn Risk (Model Prediction)** |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **High Client Value** | **PRIORITY 1: Intensive Retention**      | **NURTURE & UPSELL**                  |
|                       | (Proactive, personalized outreach, high-value offers, dedicated support) | (Maintain satisfaction, explore cross-sell/upsell opportunities, loyalty programs) |
| **Low Client Value**  | **PRIORITY 2: Automated/Low-Cost Retention** | **STANDARD SERVICE / MONITOR**        |
|                       | (Automated re-engagement (emails, nudges), cost-effective offers, or strategically accept churn if intervention cost > potential value) | (Standard service levels, monitor for any changes in risk) |

**Defining the Segments:**

*   **High/Low Churn Risk:** This would be determined by the output of your churn models (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days` or `Is_Churned_Engage_270Days`).
    *   Clients with a churn probability above a chosen operational threshold (e.g., 0.4 for the 90-day model, or 0.5 for the 270-day model) would be classified as \"High Churn Risk.\"
    *   Those below the threshold would be \"Low Churn Risk.\"

*   **High/Low Client Value:** This dimension requires a definition of client value based on Religare's business metrics. Potential approaches include:
    *   **Historical Brokerage:** Clients in the top X% (e.g., 20-30%) of brokerage generated over a significant period (e.g., last 12 or 36 months – features like `Trade_Sum_365D` from the ABT can inform this).
    *   **Assets Under Management (AUM):** Clients with AUM above a certain threshold (features like `AUM_SnapshotMonth_RunningTotal` can inform this).
    *   **Trading Frequency/Volume:** Highly active traders, even if brokerage per trade is low, might be considered high value due to consistency.
    *   **Product Penetration:** Clients using multiple Religare products/services might be considered higher value.
    *   **`Historical_Tag` (from ABT):** The 'Platinum', 'Gold' tags derived from the Excel classification (which considers a mix of activity, AUM, brokerage, recency) could serve as a ready-made proxy for value segmentation for this illustrative purpose. For example:
        *   High Value: \"Platinum,\" \"Gold\"
        *   Low Value: \"Silver,\" \"Classic,\" \"New\"
    *   A combination of these factors could also be used to create a composite value score.

**Actionable Strategies per Quadrant:**

*   **High Value / High Churn Risk (Top Priority):** These are the most critical clients to retain. Strategies could include personalized outreach from relationship managers, tailored retention offers, addressing specific service issues, or loyalty benefits.
*   **High Value / Low Churn Risk (Nurture & Upsell):** These are valuable, stable clients. Focus on maintaining satisfaction, deepening the relationship, and identifying opportunities for cross-selling or upselling additional services.
*   **Low Value / High Churn Risk (Automated/Low-Cost Retention):** For these clients, high-cost interventions may not be justified. Automated re-engagement campaigns (e.g., targeted emails with educational content, small incentives, platform feature highlights) can be employed. In some cases, if the cost to serve/retain exceeds their potential value, churn might be accepted.
*   **Low Value / Low Churn Risk (Standard Service / Monitor):** Provide standard service levels. Monitor this group for any shifts into higher-risk categories.

By implementing this matrix-based approach, Religare can strategically deploy its retention resources, maximizing the impact on preserving valuable customer relationships and overall profitability.\"

**How to Get the \"Data\" for This (for your report and for Religare to implement):**

1.  **Churn Risk Data (You already have this):**
    *   Your ABT, after being scored by your trained models, will have `ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate`, and a `Probability_Churn_XXXDays`.
    *   You apply an operational threshold to this probability to get a binary \"High Churn Risk\" / \"Low Churn Risk\" flag.

2.  **Client Value Data/Segmentation (This is where you need to define it for the report or make recommendations):**
    *   **For Your Report (Illustrative):**
        *   You can **use the `Historical_Tag`** that you engineered in Cell 13 of the ABT generation script. This tag is already in your final ABT.
            *   Define: \"High Value\" = clients with `Historical_Tag` in ('Platinum', 'Gold'). \"Low Value\" = others.
            *   You can then actually create this 2x2 matrix for your *test set* data (or a recent snapshot) and show the *distribution* of clients in each quadrant. This would be a powerful visual.
            *   **Example PySpark code snippet (conceptual, after scoring and adding `Historical_Tag` to predictions):**
                ```python
                # Assume predictions_df has ClientCode, SnapshotDate, Churn_Risk_Flag (0/1), Historical_Tag
                value_map = {
                    \"Platinum +\": \"High Value\", \"Platinum\": \"High Value\", \"Gold\": \"High Value\",
                    \"Silver\": \"Low Value\", \"Classic\": \"Low Value\", \"New\": \"Low Value\"
                }
                mapping_expr = create_map([lit(x) for x in chain(*value_map.items())]) # from pyspark.sql.functions
                
                predictions_df_with_value = predictions_df.withColumn(
                    \"Value_Segment\", mapping_expr[col(\"Historical_Tag\")]
                )
                
                # Create the 2x2 matrix counts
                client_segments_summary = predictions_df_with_value.groupBy(\"Value_Segment\", \"Churn_Risk_Flag\").count()
                client_segments_summary.show()
                ```
        *   Alternatively, you can use a simpler metric already in your ABT like `Trade_Sum_365D`. Define a threshold (e.g., top 25th percentile of `Trade_Sum_365D` are \"High Value\").

    *   **For Religare to Implement (Your Recommendation):**
        *   Recommend that Religare define \"Client Value\" based on their internal business rules and available data. This might be a composite score they already use or one they can develop using metrics like:
            *   Total Brokerage Generated (e.g., last 12 months)
            *   AUM
            *   Trading Frequency/Volume
            *   Length of Relationship (Tenure)
            *   Product Portfolio Breadth
        *   They would then segment their clients based on this value definition.

**Adding this to your report:**

*   Place the textual explanation and the conceptual 2x2 matrix figure in Section 11.
*   If you choose to generate the *actual counts* for the 2x2 matrix using your test set data and the `Historical_Tag` (or another proxy for value from your ABT), you can present that as a table within Section 11 or as an Annexure. This would be a very strong addition, showing a practical application.

3.  Generated predictions on `test_df` (e.g., `final_predictions_rf_tuned` from Cell 8).
4.  Applied an operational threshold to get a binary churn risk flag (as discussed in Cell 12, or use the default `prediction` column).

**Assumptions for the Code:**

*   `final_predictions_rf_tuned`: DataFrame containing predictions for `test_df`. It must include:
    *   `ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate`
    *   `Historical_Tag` (from the original ABT)
    *   A binary churn prediction column, let's call it `Churn_Risk_Prediction_Flag` (this would be `1` if predicted to churn based on your chosen threshold, `0` otherwise. If using default 0.5, this is the `prediction` column from the model output).
    *   The `TARGET_COL` (e.g., `Is_Churned_Engage_90Days`) to also see actuals in the segments.
*   We will define \"High Value\" vs. \"Low Value\" based on `Historical_Tag`.
*   We will define \"High Churn Risk\" vs. \"Low Churn Risk\" based on `Churn_Risk_Prediction_Flag`.

**Explanation of this New Cell (e.g., Cell 14):**

1.  **Input DataFrame:** It assumes `final_predictions_rf_tuned` is available from Cell 8 (the DataFrame that includes `ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate`, `Historical_Tag`, the `prediction` column from the RF model, and the actual `TARGET_COL`).
    *   **Important:** If `final_predictions_rf_tuned` from Cell 8 was the *narrowed* version (only `TARGET_COL`, `probability`, `prediction`), then this cell needs to first join these predictions back to the `test_df` to get `Historical_Tag` and other necessary base columns. The code from Cell 8 (the one you last successfully ran) had:
        ```python
        final_predictions_rf_tuned = predictions_base_df.select(
            TARGET_COL, 
            \"probability\", 
            \"prediction\"
        )
        ```
        This means it *is* the narrowed version. So, **we MUST adjust.**

Let's correct the assumption about `final_predictions_rf_tuned`. It only has 3 columns. We need to use `test_df` and join the `prediction` column to it.

**Key Changes in this \"Corrected New Cell 14\":**

1.  **Input Data for Matrix:**
    *   It now explicitly runs `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned.transform(test_df)` to get `predictions_for_segmentation`.
    *   Then, it `select`s the necessary columns (`ClientCode`, `SnapshotDate`, `Historical_Tag`, `TARGET_COL`, and the model's `prediction` aliased to `Churn_Model_Prediction`) into `df_for_matrix`. This ensures all required data is present.
    *   `df_for_matrix` is then persisted.
2.  **Robustness:** Checks for missing columns are done on `df_for_matrix`.
3.  **Pivot Table Ordering:** Added `.reindex()` to the Pandas pivot table creation to try and force a more standard 2x2 layout (High Value/Low Value rows, High Risk/Low Risk columns).
4.  **Error Handling for Pivot:** Added a `try-except` around the pivot table display, so if it fails for some reason (e.g., unexpected segment names not in reindex list), it will still show the raw Spark DataFrame summary.
5.  **Using `pyspark_count` and `pyspark_sum`:** Explicitly using the imported functions for clarity.

**Before Running this Corrected Cell 14:**

*   Ensure **Cell 5** (ML Pipeline Setup) has run in the current session, which loads `test_df` from disk and persists it.
*   Ensure **Modified Cell 8** (Re-train FINAL Best RF Model) has run, which defines and trains `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`.
*   Ensure `TARGET_COL` is correctly set from Cell 3.

This cell will provide the counts for your 2x2 matrix, which you can then use to populate the visual/table in your report's Section 11. It also calculates the actual churn rate within each of these strategically important segments."""),

**Necessary Cells to Re-run Before Cell 14 (after a Kernel Restart):**

1.  **Cell 1 (Setup):**
    *   **Why:** Initializes SparkSession, mounts Google Drive (if applicable), defines all essential paths (including `abt_path`, `train_df_path`, `test_df_path`, `abt_output_dir`), and global constants like `TARGET_COL` (though `TARGET_COL` is usually set in Cell 3).
    *   **Critical for:** Spark functionality, file system access, path definitions.

2.  **Cell 2 (Load ABT and Initial Exploration - *Light Version*):**
    *   **Why:** Cell 3 needs `abt_df.columns` to define `feature_columns`.
    *   **What to run:** At a minimum:
        ```python
        abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)
        # abt_df.printSchema() # Optional, but good for verification
        ```
    *   You can comment out `abt_df.persist()`, `abt_df.count()`, and `abt_df.describe()` to save time and memory, as the full `abt_df` isn't directly used by Cell 14 if `test_df` is loaded from its Parquet file.
    *   **Critical for:** Defining `abt_df` so Cell 3 can access its schema.

3.  **Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection and Feature Definition):**
    *   **Why:** Defines the Python variables `TARGET_COL` (e.g., `\"Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\"`) and `feature_columns`.
    *   Cell 5 needs `TARGET_COL` and `feature_columns` to define the ML pipeline correctly. Cell 14 also uses `TARGET_COL`.
    *   **Critical for:** Defining essential Python variables used in subsequent modeling and analysis cells.

4.  **Cell 4 (Data Splitting - Time-Based, writing to disk):**
    *   **Why:** This cell creates (or overwrites) `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` on disk. Cell 5 will load these.
    *   Even if the files exist from a previous run, re-running Cell 4 ensures the process is complete and paths are correctly referenced for Cell 5. It should be relatively quick if it's just overwriting.
    *   **Critical for:** Ensuring `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` are available and correctly defined for Cell 5.

5.  **Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup):**
    *   **Why:** This cell:
        *   Loads `train_df` and `test_df` from the Parquet files (created by Cell 4).
        *   **Persists `train_df` and `test_df` in memory.** This is important because Cell 8 (or its modified version) will train on `train_df` and Cell 14 will use `test_df`.
        *   Defines the initial `pipeline` Python object (containing assembler, scaler, and the LR model definition). Cell 8 uses the assembler and scaler stages from this `pipeline`.
    *   **Critical for:** Loading and preparing `train_df` and `test_df` as Spark DataFrame objects, and defining the base `pipeline` structure.

6.  **Modified Cell 8 (Re-train FINAL Best RF Model ONLY, Evaluate, & SAVE):**
    *   **Why:** This cell trains (or re-trains if you're resuming) the `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` using the known best hyperparameters. Cell 14 *needs* this trained model object to make predictions on `test_df`.
    *   This cell also saves the model to disk, which is good, but for Cell 14 to run immediately after, it uses the in-memory `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` object.
    *   **Critical for:** Creating the `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` object.

**Cells you can LIKELY SKIP before running Cell 14 (assuming you are resuming after a successful Cell 8 run previously):**

*   **Cell 6 (Logistic Regression):** Not a direct dependency for Cell 14 if Cell 8 (RF) is run.
*   **Cell 7 (Initial Random Forest - if you had a separate one):** Not a dependency.
*   **The *tuning part* of the original full Cell 8 (if you are using the \"Modified Cell 8\" that just re-trains with known params):** The modified Cell 8 already skips the lengthy tuning.
*   **Cell 10 (Save Model & Metrics - if logic is now inside Modified Cell 8):** The saving is now part of the modified Cell 8.
*   **Cell 11 (Feature Importances - if you just want the 2x2 matrix):** Not a direct dependency for Cell 14.
*   **Cell 12 (Threshold Adjustment - if you just want the 2x2 matrix with default 0.5 prediction):** Not a direct dependency for Cell 14.
*   **Cell 13 (Summary - if you just want the 2x2 matrix):** Not a dependency.

**So, the streamlined sequence to get to Cell 14 after a kernel restart is:**

1.  **Run Cell 1**
2.  **Run Cell 2 (light version: just define `abt_df`)**
3.  **Run Cell 3 (define `TARGET_COL`, `feature_columns`)**
4.  **Run Cell 4 (create/overwrite `train_df.parquet`, `test_df.parquet`)**
5.  **Run Cell 5 (load `train_df`, `test_df` from Parquet, persist them, define `pipeline`)**
6.  **Run \"Modified Cell 8\" (re-trains `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` with known best params)**
7.  **Then, run \"Corrected New Cell 14\" (for the 2x2 matrix).**

This ensures all Python variables (`TARGET_COL`, `feature_columns`), Spark DataFrame objects (`test_df`), and Spark ML Model objects (`final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`) required by Cell 14 are properly initialized and available in the current Spark session."""),

This significantly speeds up the resuming process!

Here's the updated, much faster sequence to get to Cell 14 if Cell 8 previously saved the model:

**Streamlined Sequence to Run Cell 14 (if best RF model was saved by Cell 8):**

1.  **Restart Kernel (if not already done).**
2.  **Cell 1 (Setup):** **MUST RUN.** (Initializes Spark, mounts Drive, defines paths including `abt_output_dir`, `TARGET_COL` if defined here, though usually Cell 3).
3.  **Cell 2 (Load ABT - *Light Version*):** **MUST RUN (partially).**
    *   Needed if Cell 3 relies on `abt_df.columns`. Run: `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)`
4.  **Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection and Feature Definition):** **MUST RUN.**
    *   Defines `TARGET_COL` (e.g., `\"Is_Churned_Engage_90Days\"`) and `feature_columns`. These Python variables are essential.
5.  **Cell 4 (Data Splitting - Time-Based, writing to disk):** **MUST RUN.**
    *   This creates/overwrites `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet`. Cell 5 needs to read `test_df.parquet`.
6.  **Cell 5 (ML Pipeline Setup - *Modified for this scenario*):**
    *   **MUST RUN, but only the part that loads `test_df`.** We don't need to define the full `pipeline` object or load `train_df` if we are just loading a saved *pipeline model*.

        # if we are loading a full PipelineModel.

8.  **SKIP the training part of \"Modified Cell 8\".**
9.  **NEW Cell 8.5 (Load Saved Best RF Model):** This cell is inserted before Cell 14.
    ```python

            print(\"Successfully loaded saved tuned RF model.\")

    else:
        print(\"Skipping loading saved model: TARGET_COL or abt_output_dir not defined.\")
        # Consider raising an error if these are critical for proceeding
    ```
10. **Then, run \"Corrected New Cell 14\" (for the 2x2 matrix).**
    *   Cell 14 needs `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned` (now loaded from disk) and `test_df` (loaded and persisted in the modified Cell 5).

**Summary of this Much Faster Resuming Sequence:**

1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Run Cell 1.**
3.  **Run Cell 2 (very light version, just for `abt_df` schema for Cell 3).**
4.  **Run Cell 3.**
5.  **Run Cell 4.**
6.  **Run \"Modified start of Cell 5\" (loads and persists only `test_df`).**
7.  **Run \"New Cell 8.5\" (loads the saved `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`).**
8.  **Run \"Corrected New Cell 14\".**

This is much more efficient as it bypasses all model training and relies on your previously saved, successfully trained model. This is the ideal workflow once a good model has been trained and saved."""),

The variable `model_data_temp_dir` was defined in **Cell 4 (Data Splitting)**:
```python
# In Cell 4
model_data_temp_dir = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, \"model_data_temp/\")
```
And `abt_output_dir` was defined in **Cell 1 (Setup)**.

If you restart the kernel and only run a *modified* Cell 5 without having run Cell 1 (to define `abt_output_dir`) and Cell 4 (to define `model_data_temp_dir`), then `model_data_temp_dir` will indeed be undefined when the \"Modified start of Cell 5\" tries to use it.

**Corrected Resuming Sequence (Ensuring all necessary path variables are defined):**

1.  **Restart Kernel.**
2.  **Run Cell 1 (Setup):**
    *   This defines `google_drive_base_path`, `abt_output_dir`, etc.
    *   It also initializes Spark.

3.  **Run Cell 2 (Load ABT - *Light Version*):**
    *   Needed for `abt_df.columns` in Cell 3. Just run `abt_df = spark.read.parquet(abt_path)`.

4.  **Run Cell 3 (Target Variable Selection and Feature Definition):**
    *   Defines `TARGET_COL` and `feature_columns`.

5.  **Run Cell 4 (Data Splitting - Time-Based, writing to disk):**
    *   **CRITICAL FOR PATHS:** This cell defines `model_data_temp_dir`, `train_df_path`, and `test_df_path`.
    *   Even if `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` already exist on disk, running Cell 4 ensures these Python path variables are correctly defined in the current session's memory. It will overwrite the Parquet files, which is usually quick if the data source (`abt_df` from Cell 2, which is just pointing to disk) hasn't changed.

6.  **Run \"Modified start of Cell 5\" (Loads and persists only `test_df`):**
    *   Now `model_data_temp_dir` (from running Cell 4) and `test_df_path` will be defined.
    *   This cell should load `test_df` successfully.

7.  **Run \"New Cell 8.5\" (Loads the saved `final_pipeline_model_rf_tuned`).**

8.  **Run \"Corrected New Cell 14\" (for the 2x2 matrix).**

**Why running Cell 4 is important here even if files exist:**

Python variables like `model_data_temp_dir` are stored in the kernel's memory for the current session. When you restart the kernel, this memory is wiped clean. You need to re-execute the cells that define these variables. Cell 4 is where `model_data_temp_dir` is constructed and assigned.

So, the sequence is:
**Cell 1 -> Cell 2 (light) -> Cell 3 -> Cell 4 -> Cell 5 (modified for test_df load) -> Cell 8.5 (load model) -> Cell 14.**

This should resolve the `NameError` for `model_data_temp_dir`."""),

This confirms:
1.  `model_data_temp_dir`, `train_df_path`, and `test_df_path` are now defined Python variables in your current session.
2.  `train_df.parquet` and `test_df.parquet` have been freshly written (or overwritten) to your Google Drive.

You are now perfectly set up to proceed with the rest of the streamlined sequence for getting to Cell 14:

**Next Steps (Continuing from your current state):**

1.  **Run \"Modified start of Cell 5\"**:
    *   This will load `test_df` from `/content/drive/MyDrive/Tables/output_abt_final_pred/model_data_temp/test_df.parquet`.
    *   It will persist `test_df` in memory.
    *   (It would also load and persist `train_df` if we were going to re-train, but for just getting to Cell 14 via a saved model, only `test_df` is strictly needed *by Cell 14* if the model is already trained).
    *   However, the \"Modified start of Cell 5\" I last gave you loads *only test_df*:
        ```python
        # --- Modified start of Cell 5 for resuming to use saved model ---
        print(\"\\n--- Loading Test Data for Prediction with Saved Model ---\")
        # Ensure model_data_temp_dir is defined from Cell 1 or Cell 4
        # Ensure abt_output_dir is defined from Cell 1
        model_data_temp_dir = os.path.join(abt_output_dir, \"model_data_temp/\") # Re-define for safety if Cell 4 wasn't just run
        test_df_path = os.path.join(model_data_temp_dir, \"test_df.parquet\") 

        try:
            print(f\"Loading test data from: {test_df_path}\")
            test_df = spark.read.parquet(test_df_path)
            test_df.persist()
            test_count_loaded = test_df.count() # Action
            print(f\"Successfully loaded test_df with {test_count_loaded} rows.\")
            if test_count_loaded == 0:

            print(f\"Error in modified Cell 5 (loading test_df): {e}\")
            raise e
        ```

You are absolutely correct! The function `chain` is **not** part of `pyspark.sql.functions`. It's a standard Python utility from the `itertools` module.

I mistakenly included it in the Spark imports. It's used for flattening the list of items for the `create_map` function.

**Correction for Cell 14 (and potentially other cells if `chain` was used elsewhere with Spark imports):**

1.  **Modify the import statement at the top of Cell 14.**

This line correctly uses `chain` from `itertools` to flatten the dictionary items into a list suitable for `create_map`. The error was purely in where `chain` was being imported from.

1.  **Modify Cell 14:**
    *   Remove `chain` from the `from pyspark.sql.functions import ...` line.

Let's break down what these matrices tell us:

**Common Observations for Both Windows:**

*   **\"Unknown Value\" is 0:** This is good; it means all your clients in the test set had a `Historical_Tag` that mapped to either \"High Value\" or \"Low Value\" based on our defined `value_map_dict`.
*   **Prediction Threshold:** Both matrices are based on the default 0.5 prediction threshold of your Random Forest models.
*   **Client Snapshots:** The counts represent client-snapshot instances in your test set.

---

**Analysis of 90-Day Churn Window Matrix:**

*   **Client Snapshot Counts (Pivot Table):**
    *   `High Value / High Churn Risk`: **24** (A very small, highly targeted group)
    *   `High Value / Low Churn Risk`: 36,335
    *   `Low Value / High Churn Risk`: 29,186
    *   `Low Value / Low Churn Risk`: 2,460,126 (The vast majority)

*   **Actual Churners in Segment (Pivot Table):**
    *   `High Value / High Churn Risk`: **15** actual churners out of 24.
    *   `High Value / Low Churn Risk`: 1,460 actual churners out of 36,335 (clients the model thought were safe but churned).
    *   `Low Value / High Churn Risk`: 18,572 actual churners out of 29,186.
    *   `Low Value / Low Churn Risk`: 21,190 actual churners out of 2,460,126 (clients the model thought were safe but churned).

*   **Churn Rate (%) within each Segment:**
    *   **`High Value / High Churn Risk`: 62.5%**
        *   This is your **top priority segment**. When the model predicts a high-value client will churn in 90 days, it's correct 62.5% of the time. The precision for this specific valuable segment is decent.
    *   `High Value / Low Churn Risk`: 4.02%
        *   These are high-value clients your model *missed*. While the percentage is low, the absolute number (1,460) is not negligible. This is where improving recall for high-value clients would be beneficial.
    *   **`Low Value / High Churn Risk`: 63.63%**
        *   The model is quite precise for this group too. You identify a large number of actual low-value churners here (18,572). This is where low-cost, automated retention efforts would be applied.
    *   `Low Value / Low Churn Risk`: 0.86%
        *   The model is very good at identifying low-value clients who won't churn. The actual churn rate here is very low.

**Insights for 90-Day Churn:**
*   The \"High Value / High Churn Risk\" segment is tiny but has a high churn rate, making interventions highly impactful if successful.
*   The model's overall precision for churners (which we saw earlier was ~63.6%) is reflected well in the `Low Value / High Churn Risk` and `High Value / High Churn Risk` segments.
*   The main area for \"missed opportunities\" (False Negatives) for high-value clients lies in the \"High Value / Low Churn Risk\" segment. If you adjusted the threshold (e.g., to 0.4 as discussed), more of these 1,460 might move into the \"High Churn Risk\" category, increasing recall for high-value clients.

---

**Analysis of 270-Day Churn Window Matrix:**

*   **Client Snapshot Counts (Pivot Table):**
    *   `High Value / High Churn Risk`: **7** (Even smaller, extremely targeted)
    *   `High Value / Low Churn Risk`: 36,352
    *   `Low Value / High Churn Risk`: 88,453
    *   `Low Value / Low Churn Risk`: 2,400,859

*   **Actual Churners in Segment (Pivot Table):**
    *   `High Value / High Churn Risk`: **5** actual churners out of 7.
    *   `High Value / Low Churn Risk`: 793 actual churners out of 36,352.
    *   `Low Value / High Churn Risk`: 56,478 actual churners out of 88,453.
    *   `Low Value / Low Churn Risk`: 22,164 actual churners out of 2,400,859.

*   **Churn Rate (%) within each Segment:**
    *   **`High Value / High Churn Risk`: 71.43%**
        *   Very high precision within this tiny, critical segment. When the 270D model flags a high-value client for long-term churn, it's very likely correct.
    *   `High Value / Low Churn Risk`: 2.18%
        *   The model is missing fewer high-value clients for this longer-term churn (793) compared to the 90D model. This aligns with the 270D model having higher overall recall for its target.
    *   **`Low Value / High Churn Risk`: 63.85%**
        *   Again, good precision for this segment. A large volume of low-value, long-term churners identified.
    *   `Low Value / Low Churn Risk`: 0.92%
        *   Very low actual churn rate here.

**Insights for 270-Day Churn:**
*   The \"High Value / High Churn Risk\" segment is exceptionally small but has a very high churn rate, making any successful retention effort here extremely valuable.
*   The model's overall precision for churners (which we saw earlier was ~63.85%) holds for both high and low-value segments when it predicts high risk.
*   The number of \"missed\" high-value churners (793 in the \"High Value / Low Churn Risk\" segment) is lower than for the 90D model, reflecting the 270D model's better overall recall (71.1% for its target class).

---

**Overall Strategic Implications from these Matrices:**

1.  **Validation of Value Segmentation:** The `Historical_Tag` (even as a proxy) combined with churn scores clearly delineates groups with vastly different churn rates and volumes. This confirms the utility of the 2x2 approach.
2.  **Targeted Interventions are Key:**
    *   For the **`High Value / High Churn Risk`** segments (24 clients for 90D, 7 for 270D in your test set): These are the clients Religare absolutely should focus on with personalized, high-effort retention strategies. The model is quite good at pinpointing them.
    *   For the **`Low Value / High Churn Risk`** segments (tens of thousands): These are suitable for automated, lower-cost re-engagement campaigns. The volume is high, but so is the likelihood of churn.
3.  **Addressing Missed High-Value Churners:**
    *   The `High Value / Low Churn Risk` segments contain actual churners that the models (at default threshold) missed.
    *   For the **90-day model**, adjusting the threshold (e.g., to 0.4 as explored in Cell 12) would shift more of these clients from \"Low Churn Risk\" to \"High Churn Risk,\" increasing the number of high-value clients targeted, at the cost of also flagging more high-value non-churners. This is a critical business trade-off discussion.
    *   For the **270-day model**, the number of missed high-value churners is smaller. Threshold adjustment could still be explored here if desired.
4.  **Efficiency:** The vast majority of clients fall into \"Low Value / Low Churn Risk\" or \"High Value / Low Churn Risk,\" where standard service or nurturing is appropriate, allowing focused resources on the high-risk segments.

This analysis is incredibly powerful for demonstrating the practical business application of your models. You should definitely include these pivot tables (or nicely formatted versions) in your report, probably in Section 10.5 (Results & Discussion) or Section 11 (Impact).

**10.5.4 Strategic Client Segmentation: Combining Churn Risk and Client Value**

\"To further enhance the actionability of the churn predictions, an analysis was conducted by segmenting clients in the test set based on their predicted churn risk (from the tuned Random Forest models at a 0.5 threshold) and a proxy for client value. Client value was categorized as 'High Value' or 'Low Value' based on the `Historical_Tag` feature (derived from the replicated Excel classification logic, where 'Platinum' and 'Gold' tags were considered High Value). This segmentation provides a 2x2 matrix for prioritizing retention efforts:

    **Insights for 90-Day Segmentation:** The 'High Value / High Churn Risk' segment, though small (24 snapshots), exhibits a very high actual churn rate (62.5%), making these clients prime candidates for immediate, focused retention. The model also identifies a large pool of 'Low Value / High Churn Risk' clients with a similar high churn rate, suitable for automated retention campaigns. The ~4% churn rate in the 'High Value / Low Churn Risk' segment highlights an area where further model refinement or threshold adjustment (as discussed in 10.5.2 - Threshold Analysis) could improve capture of at-risk valuable clients.

    **Insights for 270-Day Segmentation:** The 'High Value / High Churn Risk' segment is extremely targeted (7 snapshots) with a very high actual churn rate (71.43%), emphasizing the critical nature of retaining these few clients. The model maintains good precision (~63.85%) in identifying longer-term churners in the 'Low Value / High Churn Risk' segment. The actual churn rate among 'High Value / Low Churn Risk' clients is lower (2.18%) compared to the 90-day model, reflecting the 270-day model's higher overall recall for its target class.

**Overall Implication of Segmentation:** This 2x2 segmentation framework demonstrates a practical method for Religare to translate churn probability scores into prioritized action lists. By focusing intensive efforts on the 'High Value / High Churn Risk' quadrant and employing cost-effective strategies for the 'Low Value / High Churn Risk' quadrant, retention resources can be utilized more efficiently to maximize their impact on preserving valuable customer relationships and overall profitability.\"

**How to Integrate This:**

1.  **Placement:** Decide if this fits best as 10.5.4 or if you want to move it to Section 11 (Impact). I think 10.5.4 keeps it nicely with the model results.
2.  **Figure Numbering:** Adjust \"Figure 10.5.X\" and \"Table 10.5.X.Y\" to match your report's numbering sequence.
3.  **Visuals:**
    *   Create a simple 2x2 diagram for \"Figure 10.5.X\" (you can do this in PowerPoint, Word, or any drawing tool).
    *   The tables are directly from your Cell 14 output (the Pandas pivot tables are very report-friendly).
4.  **Wording:** Refine the wording to match your report's overall tone.
5.  **Reference to Threshold Analysis:** Note how I linked the insights back to the threshold analysis discussion for the 90-day model. This shows consistency. If you did threshold analysis for the 270D model, you can add a similar link for it.

Adding a significant new sub-section like **10.5.4 (Strategic Client Segmentation)** can have ripple effects, and it's good practice to review other sections to ensure consistency, avoid redundancy, and make sure the narrative flows well.

Here are the sections to review and potential changes to consider:

1.  **Executive Summary (Section 4):**
    *   **Current State:** Your draft already has good high-level results.
    *   **Potential Change:** You might want to add a single sentence to the \"Key Findings\" or \"Recommendations\" part of the Executive Summary that alludes to this segmentation strategy.
        *   *Example addition to Findings:* \"...Furthermore, combining churn predictions with client value (using proxies like `Historical_Tag`) allows for strategic segmentation, pinpointing high-value, high-risk clients for priority retention with observed churn rates in this segment exceeding 60-70%.\"
        *   *Example addition to Recommendations:* \"...prioritize retention efforts using a 2x2 matrix based on predicted churn risk and client value to maximize ROI.\"
    *   **Reason:** This highlights a key actionable outcome directly in the summary.

2.  **Introduction (Section 9 - specifically 9.3 Problem Statement or 9.4 Project Objectives):**
    *   **Current State:** Focuses on predicting churn and enabling timely interventions.
    *   **Potential Change (Minor):** You could subtly ensure that the language about \"enabling data-driven and timely interventions\" or \"actionable insights for retention strategies\" implicitly covers this kind of strategic segmentation, even if not explicitly detailed in the intro. No major change is likely needed here if the current wording is broad enough. The main detail belongs in 10.5.4.

3.  **Section 10.2.4 (Feature Engineering - specifically the \"Historical Excel-Based Classification\"):**
    *   **Current State:** Describes adding `Historical_Tag` and `Historical_Total_Score`.
    *   **Potential Change:** You can now add a sentence here foreshadowing its use: \"While these `Historical_Tag` and `Historical_Total_Score` features were not used as direct inputs for the initial churn models in this iteration, the `Historical_Tag` proved valuable for subsequent client segmentation analysis when combined with model predictions (see Section 10.5.4).\"
    *   **Reason:** Connects the creation of this feature to its eventual use.

4.  **Section 11 (Impact):**
    *   **Current State:** Has \"11.1 Potential Quantitative Impact\" and \"11.2 Potential Qualitative Impact.\"
    *   **Potential Change:**
        *   If you put the detailed 2x2 matrix discussion in 10.5.4 (as we just drafted), then in Section 11.1 (Quantitative Impact), you can now make your illustrative examples even stronger. For instance, when talking about \"Optimized Allocation of Retention Budgets,\" you can directly reference the \"High Value / High Churn Risk\" segment and the number of clients in it, and the high precision for this group.
        *   Example: \"The ability to identify a highly concentrated segment of 'High Value / High Churn Risk' clients (e.g., only 24 such client-snapshots for the 90D model in the test set, but with a ~62.5% actual churn rate) means that high-cost, personalized retention efforts can be extremely targeted, drastically improving the ROI of such interventions.\"
        *   In Section 11.2 (Qualitative Impact), under \"Data-Driven Decision Making\" or \"Strategic Resource Allocation,\" you can explicitly mention the 2x2 segmentation framework as a key tool.
    *   **Reason:** Integrates the segmentation findings into the broader discussion of the project's value.

5.  **Section 12 (Key Learnings):**
    *   **Current State:** Already quite comprehensive.
    *   **Potential Change:** Under \"12.2 Customer Behavior, Segmentation, and Lifetime Value,\" you could add a specific learning point about the power of combining predictive scores with value metrics for strategic action.
        *   Example: \"A key learning was the enhanced actionability achieved by segmenting clients based on both their predicted churn risk and their value (proxied by `Historical_Tag`), allowing for a clear prioritization of retention efforts (e.g., via a 2x2 matrix).\"
    *   **Reason:** Highlights this strategic insight as a learning.

6.  **List of Tables, Graphs & Figures (Section 6):**
    *   **Change:** You will need to add entries for the new tables (e.g., \"Table 10.5.X.1: 90-Day Churn - Client Snapshot Counts per Segment\") and the new figure (\"Figure 10.5.X: Client Retention Prioritization Matrix Framework\") that you'll create for section 10.5.4.

7.  **Table of Contents (Section 5):**
    *   **Change:** Ensure the new sub-section (e.g., 10.5.4 Strategic Client Segmentation...) is included in the TOC with the correct page number.

**Summary of Review:**

*   The **Executive Summary** and **Impact (Section 11)** are the most likely places where you'd want to explicitly reference or build upon the insights from the new 2x2 segmentation.
*   Minor foreshadowing or linking sentences can be added to **Feature Engineering (10.2.4)** and **Key Learnings (12.2)**.
*   The **TOC and List of Tables/Figures** will need updating.
*   The **Introduction (Section 9)** probably needs minimal, if any, changes due to this addition.

In our discussion and the draft for **Section 10.5.4 (Strategic Client Segmentation)** and the subsequent **Corrected New Cell 14 (for generating the 2x2 matrix)**, we decided to use the **`Historical_Tag`** column as a **proxy** for client value.

Specifically, the logic implemented in the PySpark code for Cell 14 was:

1.  **`Historical_Tag` Column:** This column was created in **Cell 13 of the ABT Generation script (`generate_predictive_abt.ipynb`)**. It replicates the logic of your Excel classification, which assigns tags like \"New,\" \"Classic,\" \"Silver,\" \"Gold,\" \"Platinum,\" \"Platinum +\" based on a `Historical_Total_Score`. This total score itself was derived from activity, AUM, brokerage, and recency metrics, with a dynamic `Status_Score` based on the `Is_Churned_Engage_365Days` label.

2.  **Mapping `Historical_Tag` to \"High Value\" / \"Low Value\":**
    In \"Corrected New Cell 14\" (for the 2x2 matrix), we defined this mapping:
    ```python
    # In Cell 14 (Churn_Modeling.ipynb)
    value_map_dict = {
        \"Platinum +\": \"High Value\", 
        \"Platinum\": \"High Value\", 
        \"Gold\": \"High Value\",
        \"Silver\": \"Low Value\", 
        \"Classic\": \"Low Value\", 
        \"New\": \"Low Value\"
    }
    mapping_expr = create_map([lit(x) for x in chain(*value_map_dict.items())])
    
    df_with_value_segment = df_with_risk_segment.withColumn(
        \"Value_Segment\",
        coalesce(mapping_expr[col(\"Historical_Tag\")], lit(\"Unknown Value\")) 
    )
    ```

**So, to be precise in your report:**

*   **\"High Value\" clients were defined as those whose `Historical_Tag` (derived from the replicated Excel classification logic in the ABT) was \"Platinum +\", \"Platinum\", or \"Gold\".**
*   **\"Low Value\" clients were defined as those whose `Historical_Tag` was \"Silver\", \"Classic\", or \"New\".**
*   Any client whose `Historical_Tag` might have been null or an unexpected value would fall into \"Unknown Value\" (though your output showed 0 for this, meaning all tags mapped correctly).

**Where to state this definition in your report:**

*   **Section 10.5.4 (Strategic Client Segmentation):** When you introduce the 2x2 matrix, you should explicitly state how \"Client Value\" was defined for this analysis.
    *   *Example Wording:* \"For this segmentation analysis, client value was proxied using the `Historical_Tag` feature present in the ABT. Clients tagged as 'Platinum +', 'Platinum', or 'Gold' were categorized as 'High Value,' while those tagged as 'Silver,' 'Classic,' or 'New' were categorized as 'Low Value.'\"
*   **Annexure A (Detailed ABT Feature Dictionary):** The description for `Historical_Tag` should already explain how it's derived. You could add a note there like: \"Used as a proxy for client value in segmentation analysis (Section 10.5.4), where Platinum/Gold tiers were considered High Value.\"

**Important Considerations for the Report:**

*   **Acknowledge it's a Proxy:** Clearly state that `Historical_Tag` is being used as a *proxy* for client value in this specific 2x2 matrix analysis.
*   **Explain `Historical_Tag` Derivation:** Briefly remind the reader (or refer to the ABT feature engineering section or Annexure A) that `Historical_Tag` itself is based on a composite score including activity, AUM, brokerage, recency, and a dynamic status score influenced by the 365-day churn outcome. This is important because the \"value\" definition is thus multi-faceted and also partly influenced by a long-term outcome.
*   **Recommendation for Religare's Own Value Definition:** In your recommendations (perhaps in Section 11 or the conclusion of 10.5.4), you should still suggest that for ongoing operational use, Religare should employ its own internal, more direct definition of client value (which might be based purely on historical financial metrics like total brokerage, AUM, or other business rules, without being influenced by a future churn label).

By being clear about how \"High Value\" was defined for *your analysis using available ABT features*, you maintain transparency and set the stage for Religare to potentially use a more refined internal value segmentation when they operationalize the churn scores."""),
